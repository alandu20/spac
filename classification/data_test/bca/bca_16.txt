Item
5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 12, 2019 by Greenland Acquisition Corporation, a business company with
limited liability incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (the “Company” or “Greenland”),
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on July 12, 2019, Greenland entered into a share exchange
agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a company incorporated under
the laws of Hong Kong (“Zhongchai Holding”), Greenland Asset Management Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company
with limited liability (the “Sponsor”), in the capacity thereunder as the purchaser representative (the “Purchaser
Representative”), and Cenntro Holding Limited, the sole member of Zhongchai Holding (the “Zhongchai Equity Holder”),
pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, Greenland will consummate the
acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Zhongchai Holding through a share exchange, with Zhongchai Holding becoming
a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Greenland (the “Business Combination”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement,
the Company will issue 7,500,000 of its ordinary shares, no par value, to the Zhongchai Equity Holder.

 

On October 17, 2019, Greenland held a special
meeting in lieu of an annual meeting of its shareholders at which the shareholders voted on a proposal to adjourn the special meeting
to 10:00 am New York time on October 24, 2019. The final voting
results for this
proposal are as
follows:





 



    FOR
     
    AGAINST
     
    ABSTENTIONS

    4,748,607
     
    100,411
     
    0

 

On October 17, 2019, the Company issued
a press release announcing the adjournment of the Special Meeting. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.



 

Item
8.01 Other Events.

  



On July 12, 2019, the Company filed with the
SEC a preliminary proxy statement in connection with a special meeting of the shareholders of the Company to consider and vote
on the Business Combination and related matters. Subsequently, the Company filed an amendment to the Preliminary Proxy Statement
(the “Amended Preliminary Proxy Statement”) and on September 26, 2019, the Company filed with the SEC a definitive
proxy statement (the “Definitive Proxy Statement”).

 

As
disclosed in the Definitive Proxy Statement, on September 19, 2019, a purported class action challenging the Business
Combination was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the “District Court”),
captioned Wheby v. Greenland Acquisition Corporation, et al., Case No. 19-1758-MN (D. Del.) (the “Action”). The
Action alleged certain violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and sought, among other things, to
enjoin the Business Combination from closing (or, if consummated, to rescind the Business Combination or award rescissory
damages), to require the Company to issue a separate proxy statement, and to receive an award of attorneys’ fees and
costs. The Company believes that the allegations in the complaint are without merit and denies that any further disclosure
beyond that already contained in the Preliminary Proxy Statement is required under applicable law to supplement the
Preliminary Proxy Statement included therein which has been disseminated to shareholders of the Company. Nonetheless, in
order to moot plaintiff’s unmeritorious disclosure claims, avoid nuisance and possible expenses, and provide additional
information to the shareholders, the Company determined to voluntarily make minor modifications to the Definitive Proxy
Statement, which the Company deemed immaterial.

 

On
October 14, 2019, the plaintiff, the Company and all other named defendants in the Action entered into a confidential memorandum
of understanding (the “MOU”), pursuant to which a Stipulation and Order of Dismissal (“Stipulation of Dismissal”)
of the Action was filed on October 14, 2019. The Stipulation of Dismissal was approved and entered by the District Court on October
15, 2019. Among other things, the Stipulation of Dismissal acknowledged that the Definitive Proxy Statement mooted the plaintiff’s
claims regarding the sufficiency of disclosures, dismissed all claims asserted in the Action, with prejudice as to the plaintiff
only, permits the plaintiff to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in connection with the mooted claims, and reserves the defendants’
rights to oppose such an award, if appropriate.



  

On October 17, 2019, the Company
issued a press release announcing the entry of the MOU and the District Court’s approval of the Stipulation of Dismissal.
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.
