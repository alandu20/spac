This
current report on Form 8-K contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements
that are not historical facts, including statements about the pending transaction between Priority Holdings, LLC (“Priority”),
M I Acquisitions, Inc. (“M I”) and the transactions contemplated thereby, and the parties’ perspectives and
expectations, are forward looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the proposed
transaction between Priority and M I, including the anticipated initial enterprise value and post-closing equity value, the benefits
of the proposed transaction, integration plans, expected synergies and revenue opportunities, anticipated future financial and
operating performance and results, including estimates for growth, the expected management and governance of the combined company,
and the expected timing of the transactions contemplated by the contribution agreement between M I and Priority dated February
26, 2018, as subsequently amended and restated on March 26, 2018 and April 17, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”). The
words “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan” and similar
expressions indicate forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and
are subject to various risks and uncertainties, assumptions (including assumptions about general economic, market, industry and
operational factors), known or unknown, which could cause the actual results to vary materially from those indicated or anticipated.

 

Such
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (i) risks related to the expected timing and likelihood of completion
of the pending transaction, including the risk that the transaction may not close due to one or more closing conditions to the
transaction not being satisfied or waived, such as regulatory approvals not being obtained, on a timely basis or otherwise, or
that a governmental entity prohibited, delayed or refused to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction or required
certain conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals, or that the required approval of the Purchase
Agreement by the stockholders of M I was not obtained; (ii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could
give rise to the termination of the Purchase Agreement; (iii) the risk that there may be a material adverse change with respect
to the financial position, performance, operations or prospects of Priority or M I; (iv) risks related to disruption of management
time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (v) the risk that any announcements relating to the proposed
transaction could have adverse effects on the market price of M I’s common stock; (vi) the risk that the proposed transaction
and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of Priority and M I to retain customers and retain and hire key
personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers and customers and on their operating results and businesses generally;
(vii) risks related to successfully integrating the businesses of the companies, which may result in the combined company not
operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; (viii) the risk that the combined company may be unable to achieve cost-cutting
synergies or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies; and (ix) risks associated with the financing of the
proposed transaction.  

 

A
further list and description of risks and uncertainties can be found in M I’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2017 that M I filed with the SEC and in the Definitive Proxy Statement that M I filed with the SEC, and
other documents that the parties may file or furnish with the SEC, which you are encouraged to read. Should one or more of these
risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from
those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate only to the date they were made, and M I, Priority, and
their subsidiaries undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
they were made except as required by law or applicable regulation.
