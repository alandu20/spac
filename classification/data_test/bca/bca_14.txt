Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On August 21, 2019, Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. (Atkins)  entered into a Stock and Unit Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Voyage Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Voyage Holdings), VMG Quest Blocker, Inc., a Delaware corporation (VMG Blocker, and together with Voyage Holdings, the Target Companies), VMG Voyage Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, VMG Tax-Exempt II, L.P. a Delaware limited partnership (together with VMG Voyage Holdings, LLC, the VMG Sellers), The Michael K. Osborn and Kaplana P. Osborn Revocable Living Trust, The Ava M. Osborn 2018 Irrevocable Gift Trust, The Cole M. Osborn 2018 Irrevocable Gift Trust, Ronald Penna and Thomas Bilyeu, Voyage Employee Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, the Sellers), and solely for the purposes of Section 8.10 therein, the Restricted Sellers (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Atkins is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Simply Good Foods Company (the Company).
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company will acquire Quest Nutrition, LLC at the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby (the Acquisition), via Atkins acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of each of Voyage Holdings and VMG Blocker for a cash purchase price of $1,000,000,000 (subject to customary adjustments for the Target Companies levels of cash, indebtedness, net working capital and transaction expenses as of the closing). Quest Nutrition, LLC is wholly owned by Voyage Holdings.
 
Closing Conditions
 
The obligation of the parties to the Purchase Agreement to consummate the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including (i) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) the absence of any injunction or order that prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Acquisition, and (iii) certain other customary conditions. There is no financing condition.
 
Termination
 
The Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Atkins, Sellers Representative and VMG Sellers, including, among others, a mutual termination right if the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are not consummated by December 19, 2019.
 
Other Terms
 
The Purchase Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities of the parties customary for a transaction of this type, including, without limitation, covenants regarding the conduct of the business of the Target Companies prior to the closing.
 
The representations and warranties of Atkins, the Sellers and the Target Companies contained in the Purchase Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of Atkins, the Sellers and the Target Companies, as applicable. In addition, such representations and warranties (i) have been made only for purposes of the Purchase Agreement, (ii) have been qualified by confidential disclosures made between the parties in connection with the Purchase Agreement, (iii) are subject to materiality qualifications contained in the Purchase Agreement which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors, (iv) were made only as of the date of the Purchase Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Purchase Agreement and (v) have been included in the Purchase Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between the contracting parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, the Purchase Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding Atkins, the Sellers, the Target Companies, the Company or their respective business.
 
Investors should not rely on the representations and warranties or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Atkins, the Target Companies, or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement should not be read alone, but should
