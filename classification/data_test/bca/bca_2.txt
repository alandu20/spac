Item 1.01 Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement.

 

BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT

 

This section describes the material provisions
of the Business Combination Agreement but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. Proficient’s stockholders,
warrant holders, rights holders and other interested parties are urged to read such agreement in its entirety. The following summary
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Business Combination Agreement, a copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit 2.1. Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used below are defined in the Business Combination
Agreement.

 

General Description of the Business Combination
Agreement

 

On March 10, 2020, Proficient
Alpha Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Proficient”), entered into a Business Combination Agreement
(the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Lion Financial Group Limited, a corporation organized under
the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Lion”), Lion Group Holding Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Lion (“Pubco”), Lion MergerCo 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Pubco (“Merger Sub”), Shih-Chung Chou, an individual, in the capacity as the Purchaser
Representative thereunder, Jian Wang and Legend Success Ventures Limited, each, in the capacity as a Seller Representative thereunder,
and each of the holders of Lion’s outstanding capital shares (the “Sellers”).

 

Pursuant to the Business
Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by
the Business Combination Agreement (the “Closing”), (a) Merger Sub will merge with and into Proficient,
with Proficient continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”), and with holders of Proficient securities
receiving substantially identical securities of Pubco, and (b) immediately prior to the Merger, Pubco will acquire all of the issued
and outstanding ordinary shares of Lion (the “Purchased Shares”) from the Sellers in exchange for Class
A and Class B ordinary shares of Pubco, with Lion becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (the “Share Exchange”,
and together with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Transactions”).

 

Exchange Consideration

 

The
total consideration to be paid by Pubco to the Sellers for the Purchased Shares shall be an aggregate number of Pubco ordinary
shares (the “Exchange Shares”) with an aggregate value (the “Exchange Consideration”)
equal to, without duplication, (i) $125,000,000, plus (or minus, if negative) (ii) Lion’s net working capital less a target
net working capital of $815,000, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of any outstanding indebtedness, net of cash and cash equivalents,
of Lion and its subsidiaries, and minus (iv) the amount of any unpaid transaction expenses of Lion, with each Pubco ordinary share
to be issued to the Sellers valued at a price equal to the price at which each share of Proficient common stock is redeemed (the
“Redemption Price”) pursuant to the redemption by Proficient of its public stockholders in connection
with Proficient’s initial business combination, as required by its amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Redemption”).
Jian Wang, the Chairman of Lion (the “Main Seller”), and Legacy Success Ventures Limited (collectively,
the “Class B Sellers”), shall each receive solely Pubco Class B ordinary shares (the “Class
B Exchange Shares”) and all of the other Sellers (the “Class A Sellers”) shall receive
solely Pubco Class A ordinary shares (the “Class A Exchange Shares”). The Pubco Class A ordinary shares
and the Pubco Class B ordinary shares will be identical in rights except that the Class B ordinary shares will (i) entitle the
holder to 10 votes per share and (ii) be convertible, at the election of the holder, into Pubco Class A ordinary shares on a one-to-one
basis.

 

The Exchange Consideration
is subject to adjustment after the Closing based on final confirmation of Lion’s net working capital, the outstanding indebtedness
of Lion and its subsidiaries net of cash and cash equivalents, and any unpaid transaction expenses of Lion, as of the date of the
Closing. If the finally determined number of Exchange Shares is (i) greater than the estimated number of Exchange Shares, Pubco
will issue an additional number of Pubco Class A ordinary shares and Pubco Class B ordinary shares equal to such difference to
the Sellers, subject to a maximum amount equal to the amount of Indemnity Escrow Property (defined below) at such time or (ii)
less than the estimated number of Exchange Shares, Pubco will cause the Escrow Agent (as defined below) to release from escrow
a number of Indemnity Escrow Shares equal to such difference to Pubco, subject to a maximum amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow
Property at such time.

 

The issuances of Pubco
ordinary shares in connection with the Share Exchange will be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon
Section 4(a)(2) thereof because securities of Pubco will be issued to a limited number of holders of Lion securities without involving
a public offering. Such issuances will also be exempted from registration in reliance upon Regulation S of the Securities Act with
regard to certain holders of Lion securities receiving Pubco ordinary shares who are qualified as non-U.S. persons thereunder.

 




      (1) 
       
    

 

 

Escrow Accounts

 

Indemnity Escrow

 

The parties agreed that
at or prior to the Closing, Pubco, the Sellers and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as escrow agent (the “Escrow
Agent” or “AST”) will enter into an Escrow Agreement, effective as of the Closing, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Proficient and Lion (the “Escrow Agreement”), pursuant to which
Pubco will deliver to the Escrow Agent a number of Class B Exchange Shares (each valued at the Redemption Price) equal to 15% of
the estimated Exchange Consideration otherwise issuable to the Sellers at the Closing (such Class B Exchange Shares, together with
any equity securities paid as dividends or distributions with respect to such shares or into which such shares are exchanged or
converted the “Indemnity Escrow Shares”) to be held, along with any dividends, distributions or income
thereon (together with the Indemnity Escrow Shares, the “Indemnity Escrow Property”) in a segregated
account (the “Indemnity Escrow Account”) and disbursed in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. The indemnity Escrow Shares will be held in the Indemnity Escrow Account for a period of 24 months after
the Closing and shall be the sole and exclusive source of payment for any post-Closing purchase price adjustment and for any post-closing
indemnification claims (other than certain fraud claims and breaches of Lion and the Sellers’ fundamental representations,
as discussed below); provided that half of the Indemnity Escrow Property will be released to the Class B Sellers on the 12 month
anniversary of the Closing. Within three business days of the 24 month anniversary of the Closing, all remaining Indemnity Escrow
Property will be released to the Class B Sellers in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement. However, an amount of Indemnity
Escrow Property equal to the value of any pending and unresolved claims will remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account until finally
resolved.

 

Earnout Escrow

 

Additionally, at the Closing,
Pubco will deliver to the Escrow Agent a number of Class B Exchange Shares (each valued at the Redemption Price) equal to thirty
percent (30%) of the estimated Exchange Consideration otherwise issuable to the Sellers at the Closing (such Class B Exchange Shares,
together with any equity securities paid as dividends or distributions with respect to such shares or into which such shares are
exchanged or converted the “Earnout Escrow Shares” and together with the Indemnity Escrow Shares, the
“Escrow Shares”) to be held, along with any dividends, distributions or income thereon (together with
the Earnout Escrow Shares, the “Earnout Escrow Property”) in a segregated account (the “Earnout
Escrow Account”) and disbursed in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

In the event that the net
income for the calendar year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Net Income”), as set forth in Pubco’s
audited financial statements, is equal to or greater than $19,000,000 (the “First Net Income Target”),
then, the Class B Sellers’ rights to 50% of the Earnout Escrow Property (the “First Half Earnout Property”)
shall vest and shall no longer be subject to forfeiture. If the 2021 Net Income is less than the First Net Income Target, but is
equal to or greater than $9,500,000, then the Class B Sellers’ rights to 50% of the First Half Earnout Property shall vest
and shall no longer be subject to forfeiture. In all other cases, the First Half Earnout Property will be forfeited.

 

In the event that the net
income for the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Net Income”), as set forth in Pubco’s
audited financial statements, is equal to or greater than $21,850,000 (the “Second Net Income Target”),
then the Class B Sellers’ rights to the remaining Earnout Escrow Property (after giving effect to any forfeitures for the
2021 calendar year, the “Second Half Earnout Property”) shall vest and shall no longer be subject to
forfeiture. If the 2022 Net Income is less than the Second Net Income Target, but is equal to or greater than $10,925,000, then
the Class B Sellers’ rights to 50% of the Second Half Earnout Property shall vest and shall no longer be subject to forfeiture.
In all other cases, the Second Half Earnout Property will be forfeited.

Termination

 

The Business
Combination Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by either Proficient or Lion if the Closing has not
occurred on or prior to June 3, 2020 (the “Outside Date”); provided that if Proficient, at its
election, either makes a three month automatic extension (an “Automatic Extension”) or receives
stockholder approval for a charter amendment to extend the term it has to consummate a business combination (a
“Charter Extension”), limited, in either case, to a maximum of two extensions in total, Proficient
can extend the Outside Date by three months in the case of the Automatic Extension or in the case of a Charter Extension the
shorter of three months and the period ending on the last day for Proficient to consummate a business combination pursuant to
the Charter Extension. If Proficient has extended the Outside Date by an Automatic Extension or a Charter Extension and the
parties are waiting solely to obtain the Required Consents and the Sellers and Lion have otherwise complied with their
obligations under the Business Combination Agreement in all material respects, Lion can also extend the Outside Date for the
shorter of one month and the period ending on the last day for Proficient to consummate a business combination pursuant to
such extension. A party is not entitled to terminate the Business Combination Agreement if the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date was caused by or the result of a breach of the Business Combination Agreement by such party (or with
respect to Lion, the Sellers, Pubco or Merger Sub).

 

The Business Combination
Agreement may also be terminated under certain other customary and limited circumstances prior the Closing, including, among other
reasons: (i) by mutual written consent of Proficient and Lion; (ii) by either Proficient or Lion if a governmental authority of
competent jurisdiction has issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Transactions, and such order or other action has become final and non-appealable; (iii) by Lion for Proficient’s uncured
breach of the Business Combination Agreement, if the breach would result in the failure of the related Closing condition; (iv)
by Proficient for the uncured breach of the Business Combination Agreement by Lion, Pubco, Merger Sub or any Seller, if the breach
would result in the failure of the related Closing condition; (v) by Proficient if there has been a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Lion since the date of the Business Combination Agreement which is uncured and continuing; or (vi) by either Proficient
or Lion if Proficient holds a special meeting of its stockholders to approve the Business Combination Agreement and the Transactions
and such approval is not obtained.

 




      (5) 
       
    

 

 

If the Business Combination
Agreement is terminated, all obligations of the parties under the Business Combination Agreement (except for certain obligations
related to public announcements, confidentiality, fees and expenses, trust account waiver, termination and general provisions)
will terminate, and no party to the Business Combination Agreement will have any further liability to any other party thereto except
for liability for certain fraud claims or for willful breach of the Business Combination Agreement prior to the termination.

 

In the event the Business
Combination Agreement is terminated by Proficient as a result of a material breach by Lion, Pubco, Merger Sub or any Seller (other
than as a result Lion and Sellers not using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consents or failure to provide
notification of certain material events, in which case, Proficient shall still be entitled to seek damages), Lion will pay Proficient
a termination fee of $2.3 million plus expenses as liquidated damages.

 

Trust Account Waiver and Releases

 

Lion, Pubco, Merger Sub
and each of the Sellers have agreed that they and their affiliates will not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind
in or to any monies in Proficient’s trust account held for its public stockholders, and have agreed not to, and waived any
right to, make any claim against the trust account (including any distributions therefrom directly or indirectly to Proficient’s
stockholders).

 

Each
Seller, on behalf of itself and its affiliates that own shares of such Seller, provided a general release of Lion and its
subsidiaries, effective as of the Closing, other than with respect to its rights under the Business Combination Agreement and
ancillary documents and certain other customary exceptions.

Shih-Chung
Chou, an affiliate of Proficient’s sponsor, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, provided a general release of
Proficient, effective as of the Closing, other than with respect to its rights under the Business Combination Agreement and
ancillary documents.

Governing Law 

 

The Business Combination
Agreement is governed by Delaware law, except that the Merger and the internal affairs of Proficient will be governed by the law
of Nevada. The Court of Chancery of Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction; provided that if it does not have subject matter
jurisdiction for any reason, then federal or state courts in Delaware will have jurisdiction.

Combination Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and
the foregoing description of the Business Combination Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. 

The
Business Combination Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other
as of the date of such agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements were made for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications
and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. The Business Combination Agreement has

Related Agreements

 

This section describes
the material provisions of certain additional agreements entered into or to be entered into pursuant to the Business Combination
Agreement (the “Related Agreements”) but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. The following
summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of each of the Related Agreements, copies of each of which
are attached hereto as exhibits. Stockholders and other interested parties are urged to read such Related Agreements in their entirety.

 

Lock-Up Agreements

On March 10, 2020,
each Class B Seller entered into a Lock-Up Agreement with Pubco and the Purchaser Representative (each, a “Lock-Up
Agreement”) with regard to the Exchange Shares to be received by such Class B Seller. In such Lock-Up Agreement,
each Class B Seller agreed that such Seller will not, during the period commencing from the Closing and ending on the six (6) month
anniversary of the Closing (or if earlier, the date on which Pubco consummates a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar
transaction with an unaffiliated third party that results in all of Pubco’s shareholders having the right to exchange their
equity holdings in Pubco for cash, securities or other property) ( the “Lock-Up Period”) (i) lend, offer,
pledge (except as provided below), hypothecate, encumber, donate, assign, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose
of, directly or indirectly, any of such Class B Seller’s Exchange Shares, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of such Class B Seller’s
Exchange Shares, or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii). Each holder
also agreed that the Escrow Shares will continue to be subject to such transfer restrictions until they are released from the Escrow
Account. However, each Class B Seller is allowed to transfer any of its Exchange Shares (other than the Escrow Shares while they
are held in the Escrow Account ) by gift, will or intestate succession or to any immediate family member (or related trust), trustor
or trust beneficiary, as a distribution to equity holders upon liquidation or to an affiliate or pursuant to a court order or settlement
agreement in divorce; provided in each such case that the transferee thereof agrees to be bound by the restrictions set forth in
the Lock-Up Agreement. The Class B Sellers are also permitted to pledge their shares during the Lock-Up Period so long as the pledgee
agrees not to exercise its remedies with respect to the Exchange Shares during the Lock-Up Period.

Non-Competition Agreements

On March 10, 2020,
each of Jian Wang and Chunning Wang (each, a “Restricted Person”) entered into a Non-Competition and
Non-Solicitation Agreement (each, a “Non-Competition Agreement”) in favor of Pubco, Proficient and Lion
and their respective present and future affiliates, successors and direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Covered
Parties”). Under each Non-Competition Agreement, for a period of three (3) years after the Closing (such period,
the “Restricted Period”), each Restricted Person agreed that he will not and will not permit his affiliates
to, without Pubco’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly engage in the business of providing contract-for-difference
trading service, insurance brokerage service, futures brokerage service, securities brokerage service and asset management service
based in the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong (the “Business”) (other than through a Covered Party) or own,
manage, finance or control, or become engaged or serve as an officer, director, member, partner, employee, agent, consultant, advisor
or representative of, a business or entity (other than a Covered Party) that engages in the Business anywhere in the Cayman Islands,
the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, Singapore, and People’s Republic of China or in any other markets in which the Covered
Parties are engaged in the Business as of the date of the Closing or during the Restricted Period. However, such Restricted Person
and his affiliates will be permitted under its Non-Competition Agreement to own passive investments of less than 3% of the total
issued and outstanding equity interests of a competitor that is publicly traded, so long as such Restricted Person and his affiliates
and immediate family members are not directly or indirectly involved in the management or control of such competitor. Under each
Non-Competition Agreement, the Restricted Person thereto and his affiliates will also be subject to certain non-solicitation and
non-interference obligations during the Restricted Period with respect to the Covered Parties’ respective (i) employees,
consultants and independent contractors, (ii) customers or clients, and (iii) vendors, suppliers, distributors, agents or other
service providers. Each such Restricted Person will also be subject to non-disparagement provisions regarding the Covered Parties

Exchange Shares (including, any shares held as Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and any additional Exchange
Shares (which, with respect to the Class B Exchange Shares, shall include only the underlying Pubco Class A ordinary shares)

securities issued as a dividend or distribution with respect thereto or in exchange therefor, the “ Registrable
Securities ”), except that Registrable Securities that are subject to transfer restrictions in the Lock-Up
Agreements may not be requested to be registered or registered until the end of the Lock-Up Period and the Escrow Shares may
not be requested to be registered or registered while they are held in the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement. Sellers holding a majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities (based on the number of shares and not voting

Agreement to make a written demand for registration under the Securities Act of all or part of the their Registrable
Securities, and other Sellers holding Registrable Securities will be entitled to join in such demand registration. Subject to
certain exceptions, if any time after the Closing, Pubco proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act

holding Registrable Securities as to the proposed filing and offer them an opportunity to register the sale of such number of
Registrable Securities as requested by them in writing, subject to customary cut-backs. In addition, subject to certain
exceptions, Sellers holding Registrable Securities will be entitled under the Seller Registration Rights Agreement to request
in writing that Pubco register the resale of any or all of such Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or F-3 and any similar
short-form registration that may be available at such time. Under the Seller Registration Rights Agreement, Pubco will
indemnify the holders of Registrable Securities and certain persons or entities related to them, such as their officers,
