Introductory
Note

 

This
Current Report on Form 8-K/A is filed as an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed
on August 1, 2019 (the “Original Form 8-K”) by Nesco Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Capitol Investment Corp.
IV (prior to the Closing (as defined below), “Capitol”)) (the “Company”) in order to correct
certain information required by Item 2.01(f) of Form 8-K (as described below) and to provide additional financial information
required by Item 9.01 of the Original Form 8-K. As previously reported in the Original Form 8-K, on July 31, 2019, the Company
completed the previously announced transactions (the “Closing”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of April 7, 2019 (as subsequently amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment No. 1”) to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 10, 2019, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Capitol, Capitol
Intermediate Holdings, LLC, Capitol Investment Merger Sub 1, LLC, Capitol Investment Merger Sub 2, LLC, NESCO Holdings, LP and
NESCO Holdings I, Inc. (“Legacy Nesco”). In addition, in connection with the Closing, and in accordance with
Section 388 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Cayman Islands Companies Law (2018 Revision), Capitol domesticated
as a Delaware corporation and changed its name to “Nesco Holdings, Inc.”

 

The
Original Form 8-K incorporated by reference, among other items, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Legacy
Nesco as of March 31, 2019 and the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the audited consolidated financial statements
of Legacy Nesco as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the
unaudited pro forma combined financial information of the Company as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. As Legacy Nesco
is deemed the accounting acquirer in connection with the Merger Agreement, the financial statements of Legacy Nesco are deemed
to be the historical financial statements of the Company. However, since the Closing occurred after June 30, 2019, the financial
statements of the Company prior to the completion of the Merger Agreement are the financial statements that the Company was required
to file, and filed on July 31, 2019, on its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2019. Therefore,
the Original Form 8-K is amended by this Amendment to provide the unaudited interim financial statements of Legacy Nesco for the
quarterly period ended June 30, 2019, which are included under Item 9.01 hereto, in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the additional corresponding information for the relevant fiscal period.

 

The
foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein is not complete and is subject to, and
qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement and Amendment No. 1, which were attached as Exhibits 2.1 and
2.2, respectively, to the Original Form 8-K, which are incorporated herein by reference. Items and exhibits previously reported
in the Original Form 8-K that are not included in this Amendment remain unchanged.

 

This
Amendment is also being filed to correct certain erroneous amounts inadvertently included in the Original Form 8-K under Item
2.01 under the heading “Form 10 Information—Certain Relationship and Related Party Transactions.” The
first paragraph under such subheading is hereby amended to read as follows: “ECP and their affiliates have ownership interests
in a broad range of companies. Nesco has entered into commercial transactions in the ordinary course of its business and on an
arms-length basis with a subsidiary of PLH Group, Inc., a company partially owned by an affiliate of ECP. Revenues derived from
these transactions have totaled $18,522,773, $10,048,447 and $5,330,369, for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively.” The second paragraph under such subheading remains unchanged.

 


Item
                          2.01.Completion
                                         of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. 

 

The
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Legacy Nesco for the three and
six month periods ended June 30, 2019 is included in this Amendment as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
