Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

 

Business Combination Agreement and Plan
of Reorganization

 

On June 18, 2020, Tortoise Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation (“TortoiseCorp”), SHLL Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of TortoiseCorp (“Merger Sub”), and Hyliion Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”),
entered into a business combination agreement and plan of reorganization (the “Business Combination Agreement”),
pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger,” together with the other
transactions related thereto, the “Proposed Transactions”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of TortoiseCorp (the “Surviving Corporation”).

 

Conversion of Securities

 

Immediately prior to the effective time
of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the Company will cause each share of the Company’s preferred stock
(“Company Preferred Stock”) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be automatically
converted into a number of shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Company Common Stock”) in accordance
with the Company’s certificate of incorporation, and each converted share of Company Preferred Stock will no longer be outstanding
and will cease to exist, such that each holder of Company Preferred Stock will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
to such securities.

 

Also immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will cause the outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest due on the Company’s outstanding convertible
notes (the “Company Convertible Notes”) immediately prior to the Effective Time to be automatically converted
into a number of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of such Company Convertible Notes, and such converted
Company Convertible Notes will no longer be outstanding and will cease to exist, and any liens securing obligations under the Company
Convertible Notes will be released.

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of TortoiseCorp, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the Company’s
securities:

 


(a)Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive the number of shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of TortoiseCorp (“TortoiseCorp
Class A Common Stock”) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) 100,000,000 by (b) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, expressed on a fully-diluted and as-converted to Company
Common Stock basis, and including, without limitation or duplication, the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Company Preferred Stock and Company Convertible Notes and the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to unexpired, issued and outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (“Company Options”)
and Company Options that the Company has committed to grant but has not yet granted as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the “Exchange Ratio”);

 


(b)All shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held in the treasury of the Company will be canceled without
any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect thereto;

 


(c)Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub (“Merger Sub Common Stock”) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;

 


(d)Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted
into an option to purchase a number of shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock (such option, an “Exchanged Option”)
equal to the product (rounded up or down to the nearest whole number, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up) of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at
an exercise price per share (rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent, with a fraction of $0.005 rounded up) equal to (A) the
exercise price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except
as specifically provided in the Business Combination Agreement, following the Effective Time, each Exchanged Option will continue
to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding
former Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 


(e)No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock will be issued upon
the exchange of Company Common Stock. Any fractional shares will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole share of TortoiseCorp
Class A Common Stock, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash settlements will be made with respect to fractional shares.

Proxy Statement

 

As promptly as practicable after the date
of the Business Combination Agreement and TortoiseCorp’s receipt of the Company’s audited financial statements, TortoiseCorp
will prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a proxy statement (as amended
or supplemented from time to time, the “Proxy Statement”) to be sent to the stockholders of TortoiseCorp (the
“TortoiseCorp Stockholders”) relating to the meeting of the TortoiseCorp Stockholders (the “TortoiseCorp
Stockholders’ Meeting”) to be held to consider (i) approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement
and the Merger, (ii) approval of the issuance of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock as contemplated by the Business Combination
Agreement and the Subscription Agreements (as defined below) and the issuance of Forward Purchase Securities (as defined below)
as contemplated by the Forward Purchase Agreement (as defined below), (iii) the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation
of TortoiseCorp and (iv) any other proposals the parties deem necessary to effectuate the Merger (collectively, the “TortoiseCorp
Proposals”).

 

Stock Exchange Listing

 

TortoiseCorp will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Proposed Transactions to be
approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange at the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”). Until the
Closing, TortoiseCorp shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock and warrants listed for
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

 

Registration Rights Agreement

 

In connection with the Closing, that certain
Registration Rights Agreement dated February 27, 2019 (the “IPO Registration Rights Agreement”) will be amended
and restated and TortoiseCorp, certain persons and entities holding securities of TortoiseCorp prior to the Closing (the “Initial
Holders”) and certain persons and entities receiving TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (the “New
Holders” and together with the Initial Holders, the “Reg Rights Holders”) shall enter into that amended
and restated IPO Registration Rights Agreement attached as an exhibit to the Business Combination Agreement (the “Registration
Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, TortoiseCorp will agree that, within 30 calendar days
after the consummation of the Proposed Transactions, TortoiseCorp will file with the SEC (at TortoiseCorp’s sole cost and
expense) a registration statement registering the resale of certain securities held by or issuable to the Reg Rights Holders (the
“Resale Registration Statement”), and TortoiseCorp shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Resale
Registration Statement declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. In certain circumstances,
certain of the Reg Rights Holders can demand up to three underwritten offerings, and all of the Reg Rights Holders will be entitled
to piggyback registration rights.

 

The foregoing description of the Registration
Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Registration Rights Agreement, a copy
of which is included as Exhibit A to the Business Combination Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report
on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.

hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish
or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, any shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock held by them immediately after the Effective Time, or issuable upon
the exercise of options to purchase shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock held by them immediately after the Effective Time,
or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock held by them immediately after
the Effective Time, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of any of such shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities,
in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii) (the actions
specified in clauses (i)-(iii), collectively, “Transfer”) until 180 days after the date of Closing (the “Closing
Date”). Thereafter until two (2) years after the Closing Date, Thomas Healy will also agree not to Transfer more than
10% of the number of shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock held by him immediately after the Effective Time, or issuable
upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock held by him immediately after the Effective
Time.

 

The foregoing description
of the Lock-Up Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Lock-Up Agreement, a copy of
which is included as Exhibit B to the Business Combination Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.

person conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction. The Company also agrees that it will promptly request
each person (other than the parties hereto and their respective representatives) that has prior to the date thereof executed a

furnished to such person by or on behalf of it prior to the date thereof. If the Company or any of its representatives receives

(and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after the Company becomes aware of such inquiry or proposal) notify such person
in writing that the Company is subject to an exclusivity agreement with respect to the sale of the Company that prohibits it from
considering such inquiry or proposal.

Termination

 

The Business Combination Agreement may
be terminated and the Proposed Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding any requisite
approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and the Proposed Transactions by the stockholders of the Company or
the TortoiseCorp Stockholders, as follows:

 


(a)By mutual written consent of TortoiseCorp and the Company;

 


(b)By TortoiseCorp or the Company, if (i) the Effective Time will not have occurred prior to the date that is 180 days after the
date of the Business Combination Agreement (the “Outside Date”); provided, however, that the Business Combination
Agreement may not be terminated by any party that either directly or indirectly through its affiliates is in breach or violation
of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein and such breach or violation is the principal
cause of the failure of a condition to the Merger on or prior to the Outside Date, and, in the event that any law is enacted after
the execution of the Business Combination Agreement extending the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the Outside Date
will be automatically extended by the length of any such extension; or (ii) any governmental authority in the United States has
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
which has become final and nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Proposed Transactions illegal or otherwise
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Proposed Transactions, including the Merger; or (iii) any of the TortoiseCorp Proposals
fail to receive the requisite vote for approval at the TortoiseCorp Stockholders’ Meeting;

 




    6
     
    

 


(c)By the Company if (i) there is an occurrence of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part
of TortoiseCorp and Merger Sub set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of TortoiseCorp
and Merger Sub will have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in representations and warranties and
the agreements and covenants of Merger Sub and TortoiseCorp specified in the conditions to the Merger section of the Business Combination
Agreement would not be satisfied (“Terminating TortoiseCorp Breach”); provided that the Company has not waived
such Terminating TortoiseCorp Breach and the Company is not then in material breach of their representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements in the Business Combination Agreement; provided, however, that, if such Terminating TortoiseCorp Breach is curable
by TortoiseCorp and Merger Sub, the Company may not terminate the Business Combination Agreement under this section for so long
as TortoiseCorp and Merger Sub continue to exercise their reasonable efforts to cure such breach, unless such breach is not cured
within thirty days after notice of such breach is provided by the Company to TortoiseCorp; or

 


(d)By TortoiseCorp if (i) the Company has failed to deliver the Written Consent to TortoiseCorp within two business days of execution
of the Business Combination Agreement; (ii) there is an occurrence of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
on the part of the Company set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company
has become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in representations and warranties and the agreements and covenants
of the Company specified in the conditions to the Merger section of the Business Combination Agreement would not be satisfied (“Terminating
Company Breach”); provided that TortoiseCorp has not waived such Terminating Company Breach and TortoiseCorp and Merger
Sub are not then in material breach of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Business Combination Agreement;
provided further that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company, TortoiseCorp may not terminate the Business
Combination Agreement under this provision for so long as the Company continues to exercise its reasonable efforts to cure such
breach, unless such breach is not cured within thirty days after notice of such breach is provided by TortoiseCorp to the Company;
or (iii) the Company has not delivered its audited financial statements to TortoiseCorp within 15 days of the date of the Business
Combination Agreement.

 

Effect of Termination

 

If the Business Combination Agreement is
terminated, the agreement will forthwith become void, and there will be no liability under the Business Combination Agreement on
the part of any party hereto, except as set forth in the Business Combination Agreement or in the case of termination subsequent
to a willful material breach of the Business Combination Agreement by a party thereto.

 

A copy of the Business Combination Agreement

of the Business Combination Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Business Combination Agreement
filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Business Combination Agreement is included to provide security holders with information
regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about TortoiseCorp, the Company or the other parties

with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement. These disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies
and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. Moreover, certain

rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, security holders should not rely on the representations and warranties
in the Business Combination Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about TortoiseCorp, the Company or Merger
Sub.

Subscription Agreements

 

In connection with the execution of the
Business Combination Agreement, on June 18, 2020, TortoiseCorp entered into separate subscription agreements (collectively, the
“Subscription Agreements”) with a number of investors (each, a “Subscriber” and collectively,
the “Subscribers”), pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed to purchase, and TortoiseCorp agreed to sell to
the Subscribers, an aggregate of 30,750,000 shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock (the “PIPE Shares”), for
a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of  $307,500,000, in a private placement (the “PIPE”).

 

The closing of the sale of the PIPE Shares
pursuant to the Subscription Agreements is contingent upon, among other customary closing conditions, the concurrent consummation
of the Proposed Transactions. The purpose of the PIPE is to raise additional capital for use by the combined company following
the Closing.

Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements,
TortoiseCorp agreed that, within 30 calendar days after the consummation of the Proposed Transactions, TortoiseCorp will file with
the SEC (at TortoiseCorp’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the PIPE Shares (the
“PIPE Resale Registration Statement”), and TortoiseCorp shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have
the PIPE Resale Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof. Under certain circumstances,
payments by TortoiseCorp may be assessed with respect to the PIPE Shares in the event that (i)  the PIPE Resale Registration
Statement has not been declared effective by the SEC by the earlier of (A) 60 days (or 90 days if the SEC notifies TortoiseCorp
that it will review the PIPE Resale Registration Statement) following the Closing and (B) the tenth business day after the SEC
notifies TortoiseCorp that either its review of the PIPE Resale Registration Statement is complete or it will not review the PIPE
Resale Registration Statement; (ii) the PIPE Resale Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC but thereafter
ceases to be effective prior to the expiration of a designated effective period or a Subscriber is not permitted to utilize the
PIPE Resale Registration Statement to resell the PIPE Shares; or (iii) under certain circumstances, TortoiseCorp fails to
file with the SEC any required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, such that the Subscribers who are
not affiliates of TortoiseCorp are unable to sell their PIPE Shares without restriction under Rule 144 under the Securities
Act. The payments by TortoiseCorp to each such Subscriber shall accrue on the default date and on each monthly anniversary of any
uncured default in an amount equal to 0.5% of the aggregate purchase price paid for the PIPE Shares held by such Subscriber at
such time, subject to certain terms and limitations (including a cap of 5.0% of the aggregate purchase price).

 

The foregoing description of the Subscription
Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the Subscription Agreement, a copy of which
is included as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.

Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Atlas Point Energy Infrastructure Fund, LLC (“Atlas Point”)
entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Agreement (the “FPA Amendment” and
such Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Agreement, as amended, the “Forward Purchase Agreement”), pursuant
to which Atlas Point agreed to purchase $17,500,000 (the “Purchase Price”) of forward purchase units, consisting of
one share of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock and one-half of one warrant, at $10.00 per unit at the Closing (the “Forward

Shares”), such that Atlas Point shall retain 365,625 Founder Shares and (ii) if Atlas Point does fund the Purchase Price,
Atlas Point shall transfer back to the Sponsor 894,375 Founder Shares.

“anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “plan,”

agreements or consummate a transaction with the Company; TortoiseCorp’s ability to obtain the financing necessary consummate
the Proposed Transactions; and the expected timing of completion of the Proposed Transactions. These statements are based on various
assumptions and on the current expectations of TortoiseCorp’s and the Company’s management and are not predictions
of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve
as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or
probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual
events and circumstances are beyond the control of TortoiseCorp and the Company. These forward-looking statements are subject to
a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, financial, legal, political and business conditions and changes
in domestic and foreign markets; the inability of the parties to enter into definitive agreements or successfully or timely consummate
the Proposed Transactions or to satisfy the other conditions to the closing of the Proposed Transactions, including the risk that
any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely
affect the combined company; the risk that the approval of the TortoiseCorp Stockholders for the Proposed Transactions is not obtained;
failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Transactions, including as a result of a delay in consummating the
Proposed Transaction or difficulty in, or costs associated with, integrating the businesses of TortoiseCorp and the Company; the
amount of redemption requests made by the TortoiseCorp Stockholders; the occurrence of events that may give rise to a right of
one or both of TortoiseCorp and the Company to terminate the Business Combination Agreement; risks related to the rollout of the
Company’s business and the timing of expected business milestones; the effects of competition on the Company’s business;
and those factors discussed in TortoiseCorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 under
the heading “Risk Factors,” and other documents of TortoiseCorp filed, or to be filed, with the SEC. If the risks materialize
or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements.
There may be additional risks that neither TortoiseCorp nor the Company presently know or that TortoiseCorp and the Company currently
believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In
addition, forward-looking statements reflect TortoiseCorp’s and the Company’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future
events and views as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. TortoiseCorp and the Company anticipate that subsequent events
and developments will cause their assessments to change. However, while TortoiseCorp and the Company may elect to update these
forward-looking statements at some point in the future, TortoiseCorp and the Company specifically disclaim any obligation to do
so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing TortoiseCorp’s or the Company’s assessments
as of any date subsequent to the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon
the forward-looking statements.
