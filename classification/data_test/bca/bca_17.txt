Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

 

Securities Purchase Agreement

 

 On November 21, 2019, AdaptHealth LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company (“Buyer”) and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of AdaptHealth Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”), McKesson Medical-Surgical, Inc., a Virginia corporation (“Seller”), NRE Holding
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“NRE”), and McKesson Patient Care Solutions, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
(“PCS”), entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which Seller agreed to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agreed to purchase from the
Seller, all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of NRE (the “Transaction”). 

   

 The base purchase price for the Transaction
is $14,000,000, payable in full in cash at the closing, subject to customary adjustments for cash, indebtedness, transaction expenses
and net working capital (as compared to an agreed target net working capital amount). In addition, Buyer may be required to make
an additional payment of $1,500,000 to Seller after the closing of the Transaction pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Transition
Services Agreement to be entered into in connection with the closing of the Transaction (the “TSA”). 

   

 The consummation of the Transaction
is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of, among other customary closing conditions, the accuracy of the representations and
warranties in the Agreement, the compliance by the parties with the covenants in the Agreement, the absence of any legal order
barring the Transaction, and the delivery of the TSA and other ancillary agreements relating to the temporary use and occupancy
of a portion of certain of Seller’s facilities by Buyer. The parties are also provided with customary termination rights, including
the right of either party to terminate the Agreement if the consummation of the Transaction has not occurred by January 31, 2020
(unless the failure of the Transaction to be consummated was principally caused by such party’s failure to perform any material
covenant, agreement or obligation under the Agreement). The Transaction is expected to close on or around December 31, 2019. 

   

 Under the Agreement, PCS and NRE made
customary representations and warranties with respect to the business of PCS and NRE, including with respect to organization and
qualification, subsidiaries, authorization, capitalization, non-contravention, financial statements, the absence of undisclosed
liabilities, the non-occurence of certain events from the date of the latest consolidated balance sheet of NRE and PCS, compliance
with laws, taxes, real property, personal property, intellectual property, contracts, litigation, employee benefits, environmental
matters, labor matters, insurance policies, transactions with affiliates, material customers, material suppliers, brokers’
fees, healthcare compliance, compliance with privacy laws, and the absence of fraud. In addition, Seller made customary representations
and warranties, including with respect to authorization, no conflicts, required filings and consents, title to the equity interests
of NRE and brokers’ fees. Certain representations of NRE and PCS are qualified in whole or in part by a material adverse
effect standard for purposes of determining whether a breach of such representations and warranties has occurred. 

   




      - 2 - 
     
    

 

Under the Agreement, Buyer made customary
representations with respect to its organization and qualification, authorization, non-contravention, brokers’ fees, absence
of litigation, having sufficient funds to consummate the transactions, and its solvency.

 

 The representations and warranties
by Seller, NRE and PCS are qualified by information in the accompanying disclosure schedules, which contain information
that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties of Seller, NRE and PCS set forth in the
Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk
among the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, investors and securityholders should not rely on
the representations and warranties in the Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Seller,
Buyer, NRE or PCS. 

   

 PCS, NRE and Seller made certain covenants under the Agreement,
including, among others, the following: 

 


 ·  subject
                                         to limited exceptions, during the period between the signing of the Agreement and the
                                         closing of the Transaction, Seller shall cause each of PCS and NRE to continue to conduct
                                         their business in the ordinary course and use commercially reasonable efforts to carry
                                         on and preserve intact their current business organizations, keep available the services
                                         of their current officers and employees, and preserve their relationships with customers,
                                         licensors, licensees and others with whom NRE and PCS have contractual or other commercial
                                         relations in substantially the same manner as such relationships existed immediately
                                         prior to the date of the Agreement; 

 


 ·  subject
                                         to limited exceptions, during the period between the signing of the Agreement and the

                                         enter into or amend material contracts; split, combine or reclassify, or issue, equity
                                         interests of NRE or PCS; issue, grant, deliver or sell, or purchase, redeem or acquire,
                                         equity interests of NRE or PCS; amend their respective organizational documents; make
                                         acquisitions; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; incur certain indebtedness; make loans
                                         or acquisitions of debt securities; revalue material assets; make or change material
                                         tax elections, adopt or change material accounting methods with respect to taxes, or
                                         settle any material tax claims;

                                         closing of the Transaction, Seller, NRE and PCS are required to provide reasonable access upon reasonable
                                         prior notice to Buyer and its representatives to the directors, officers, employees,
                                         agents, properties, offices, facilities, books and records of NRE and PCS and to furnish
                                         Buyer and its representatives with information with respect to NRE and PCS; and 

 


 ·  during the period between the signing of the Agreement and the closing of the Transaction, Seller is required not to,
                                                                                                                      and to cause its representatives not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage
                                                                                                                      or otherwise facilitate any inquiry, proposal, offer or discussion with any person concerning

                                                                                                                      of a majority of the capital stock of, or an acquisition of all or substantially all

 Each
party made certain mutual covenants under the Agreement, including, among others, to cooperate with each other and use commercially

or advisable under the Agreement, applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transaction, to obtain from
any governmental authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained
and to make any filings with or notifications or submissions to any governmental authority required to be made by such person
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction, and to

necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law or otherwise are reasonably required to obtain any consent, license, permit,
approval, waiver or authorization or order of, filing with or notification to, any third person or governmental authority required

 Each of Seller and Buyer has agreed
to indemnify the other party and its affiliates with respect to certain losses as a result of or in connection with breaches of
its respective representations and warranties, as well as, in the case of Seller, certain taxes and, in the case of Buyer, breaches
of its covenants under the Agreement. The indemnification obligations of the Seller are subject to certain customary limitations, including (i) survival periods applicable to representations and warranties of Seller, NRE and PCS, (ii) a deductible which
