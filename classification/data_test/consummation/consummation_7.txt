INTRODUCTORY
NOTE

 

On
October 24, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), the registrant consummated the previously announced business combination (the
“Business Combination”) following a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) where the
stockholders of Greenland Acquisition Corporation ( “Greenland”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”
) considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt an share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”),
dated as of July 12, 2019, entered into by and among (i) Greenland, (ii) Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a Hong Kong company
(“Zhongchai Holding”), (iii) Greenland Asset Management Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company with limited
liability, in the capacity as the purchaser representative (the “Purchaser Representative”), and (iv) Cenntro Holding
Limited, the sole member of Zhongchai Holding (the “Zhongchai Equity Holder” or the “Seller”).

 

Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement, Greenland acquired from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Zhongchai
Holding in exchange for 7,500,000 newly issued ordinary shares, no par value of the Company, to the Seller (the “Exchange
Shares”). As a result, the Seller became the controlling shareholder of the Company, and Zhongchai Holding became a directly
and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (such transaction is referred as Business Combination herein below). The Business Combination
was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by a share exchange, wherein Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer for accounting
and financial reporting purposes.

 

Prior
to the Business Combination, we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Business Combination, we have ceased to be a “shell company”
and continued the existing business operations of Zhongchai Holding as a publicly traded company under the name “Greenland
Technologies Holding Corporation.”

 

As
used in the Report henceforward, unless otherwise stated or the context clearly indicates otherwise, the terms the “Registrant,”
“Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the consolidated Company and its subsidiaries
at and after the Closing, giving effect to the Business Combination.

results of operations or cash flows.

 

INDEMNIFICATION
OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

 

Our
Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Memorandum and Articles of Association”), as amended, the BVI Business
Companies Act, 2004, the Insolvency Act, 2003 of the British Virgin Islands, each of which as amended, and the common law of British
Virgin Islands allow us to indemnify our officers and directors from certain liabilities. Our Articles provides that the Company
may indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate against all direct and indirect costs, fees and expenses of any type or nature whatsoever,
any person who (a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that such person
is or was a director, officer, key employee, adviser of the Company or who at the request of the Company; or (b) is or was, at
the request of the Company, serving as a director of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another company.

 

The
Company will only indemnify the individual in question if the relevant indemnitee acted honestly and in good faith with a view
to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe
that his conduct was unlawful. The decision of the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) as to whether an
indemnitee acted honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company and as to whether such indemnitee
had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of our
Articles, unless a question of law is involved.

 

The
termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by
itself, create a presumption that the relevant indemnitee did not act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests
of the Company or that such indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

 

The
Company may purchase and maintain insurance, purchase or furnish similar protection or make other arrangements including, but
not limited to, providing a trust fund, letter of credit, or surety bond in relation to any indemnitee or who at the request of
the Company is or was serving as a director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another
company, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by him in that capacity, whether or not the Company has
or would have had the power to indemnify him against the liability as provided in the Memorandum and Articles of Association.

 



    Item
    3.02.
    Unregistered
    Sales of Equity Securities.

 

The
disclosure set forth under Item 2.01 above is incorporated in this Item 3.02 by reference. The 7,500,000 newly issued ordinary
shares that were paid as consideration to the Seller upon the closing of the Business Combination were issued by the Company in
reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to the Section 4(a) (2) of the Securities
Act and Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act. The Seller receiving the shares represented its intention to acquire
the shares for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution, and appropriate restrictive
legends were affixed to the certificates representing the shares. The party also had adequate access, through business or other
relationships, to information about the Company and Zhongchai Holding.

Before

Holding.
