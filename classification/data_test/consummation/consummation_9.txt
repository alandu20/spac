As previously announced, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. (SCH), a Cayman Islands exempted company, previously entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019, as amended on October 2, 2019 (the Merger Agreement), by and among SCH, Vieco USA, Inc. (Vieco US), Vieco 10 Limited (V10), Foundation Sub 1,
Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SCH (Merger Sub A), Foundation Sub 2, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SCH (Merger Sub B), Foundation Sub LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SCH (Merger Sub
LLC and collectively with Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B, the Merger Subs), TSC Vehicle Holdings, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of V10 (Company A), Virgin Galactic Vehicle Holdings, Inc., an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of V10 (Company B), and Virgin Galactic Holdings, LLC (VGH, LLC), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of V10 (Company LLC and collectively with Company A and Company B, the VG Companies)
 On October 25, 2019, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and described in the section titled Domestication
Proposal beginning on page 137 of the final prospectus and definitive proxy statement, dated October 9, 2019 (the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), SCH
filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies, together with the necessary accompanying documents, and filed a certificate of incorporation and a certificate of corporate domestication with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, under which SCH was domesticated and continues as a Delaware corporation, changing its name to Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (the Domestication). 
On October 25, 2019, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and described in the section titled BCA Proposal
beginning on page 88 of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (VGH) consummated the merger transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, whereby all outstanding shares of common stock or limited liability
company interests, as applicable, of each of the VG Companies were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive 130,000,000 shares of VGH common stock (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share) for an aggregate merger consideration of
$1.3 billion (the Aggregate Merger Consideration) and (ii)(x) Merger Sub A merged with and into Company A, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub A ceasing and Company A being the surviving corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of VGH, (y) Merger Sub B, merged with and into Company B, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub B ceasing and Company B being the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of VGH and (z) Merger Sub LLC merged
with and into Company LLC, the separate company existence of Merger Sub LLC ceasing and Company LLC being the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of VGH (collectively referred to as the Mergers and together with the

to repurchase 5,209,562 shares of VGHs common stock from Vieco US at a purchase price of $10.00 per share (the Repurchase). 
In connection with the consummation of the Transactions, each issued and outstanding Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share,
of SCH was converted, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of VGH. Each of issued and outstanding Class B ordinary
share, par value $0.0001 per share, of SCH was converted, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of common stock of VGH; provided, however, that with respect to the
Class B ordinary shares of SCH held by SCH Sponsor Corp., SCH Sponsor Corp. instead received upon the conversion of the SCH Class B ordinary shares held by it 15,750,000 shares of common stock of VGH. Each issued and outstanding warrant of
SCH (the SCH warrants) converted into a warrant to acquire one share of common stock of VGH (the VGH warrants), pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated September 13, 2017, between SCH and Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company (Continental), as warrant agent. Each issued and outstanding unit of SCH, which consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-third of one SCH warrant,
converted into a unit of VGH (the VGH units), with each VGH unit representing one share of VGH common stock and one-third of one VGH warrant.

consummation of the Transactions but will not settle into shares of common stock until a date, selected by the Company, between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. 
In connection with the consummation of the Transactions, the Companys board of directors also approved a compensation program for the
Companys non-employee directors who are determined not to be affiliated with Virgin Group and/or SCH (the Director Compensation Program). The material terms of the Director Compensation
Program are described in the section of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus beginning on page 252 titled Executive CompensationDirector Compensation. Such description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Director
Compensation Program, which is included as Exhibit 10.3 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.  Compensatory Arrangements for
Executive Officers  In connection with the consummation of the Transactions, on October 25, 2019, each of the Companys
executive officers entered into new employment agreements with the Company. The material terms of the agreements for Messrs. Whitesides, Moses, Palermo and Campagna are as follows: 
George Whitesides  Pursuant to his
employment agreement, Mr. Whitesides serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and reports directly to the Companys board of directors. Mr. Whitesides service pursuant to the employment agreement will continue until
terminated in accordance with its terms. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Whitesides is entitled to receive an initial annual base salary of $450,000, subject to increase at the discretion of the Companys board of directors or a
subcommittee thereof and is eligible to receive an annual performance bonus targeted at 50% of Mr. Whitesides then-current annual base salary. The actual amount of any such bonus will be determined by reference to the attainment of
applicable Company and/or individual performance objectives, as determined by the Companys board of directors or a subcommittee thereof. Mr. Whitesides is also eligible to earn a one-time cash bonus
equal to $500,000, to be paid on the first anniversary of the achievement of a commercial launch, subject to his employment through the payment date. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Whitesides is also eligible to participate in
customary health, welfare and fringe benefit plans, provided by the Company to its employees. In addition, Mr. Whitesides is entitled to join a spaceflight in connection with the performance of his duties, and his wife is entitled to join a
spaceflight.  Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Whitesides will receive stock options to purchase an aggregate of 1,283,361
shares of the Companys common stock and a restricted stock unit award covering an aggregate of 194,844 shares of the Companys common stock. The restricted stock units were granted in connection with the closing of the Transactions,
effective as of the date of the filing of the Registration Statement on Form S-8 for the 2019 Plan, and half of the stock options were granted in connection with the closing of the Transactions and half will
be granted on the first anniversary of the closing of the Transactions, subject to his continued employment through the applicable grant date. Awards granted in connection with the closing of the Transactions will vest as to 25% of the shares
subject to the award on the one year anniversary of the closing of the Transactions and as to the remaining 75% in substantially equal monthly installments over the following 36 months, subject to continued service through the applicable vesting
date. Awards granted on the first anniversary of the closing of the Transactions will vest along the same schedule, except the vesting dates will be keyed off of the grant date (rather than the closing date of the Transactions). 
If Mr. Whitesides employment is terminated by the Company without cause, or by Mr. Whitesides for good
reason (each, as defined in the employment agreement, and referred to herein as a qualifying termination), subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor
of the Company and continued compliance with customary confidentiality and non-solicitation requirements, then, in addition to any accrued amounts, Mr. Whitesides will be entitled to receive the following
severance payments and benefits: (i) an amount equal to the sum of (a) Mr. Whitesides annual base salary then in effect and (b) his target annual bonus amount; and (ii) continued healthcare coverage for 12 months after
the termination date.  However, if either such termination of employment occurs on or within 24 months following a change in
control (as defined in the 2019 Plan), subject to his execution and non-revocation a general release of claims in favor of the Company and continued compliance with restrictive covenants, then, in
addition to any accrued amounts, Mr. Whitesides instead will be entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits: (i) an 








 
amount equal to one and one-half times the sum of (a) Mr. Whitesides annual base salary then in effect and (b) his target annual bonus
amount, (ii) continued healthcare coverage for 18 months after the termination date, and (iii) full accelerated vesting of all outstanding and unvested time-based vesting awards. 
The employment agreement contains customary confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions, and also
includes a best pay provision under Section 280G of the Code, pursuant to which any parachute payments that become payable to Mr. Whitesides will either be paid in full or reduced so that such payments are not
subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever results in the better after-tax treatment to Mr. Whitesides.
