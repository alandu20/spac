Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

Amendment No. 2 to Investment Management Trust Agreement 

 

On January 24, 2020, Gordon
Pointe Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”)
entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2018, as amended by Amendment
No. 1 to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of July 26, 2019 (the “Trust Amendment”), pursuant to
which the date on which Continental must liquidate the trust account which was established in connection with the Company’s
initial public offering (the “IPO”), in the event the Company has not consummated its initial business combination,
was extended from January 29, 2020 to February 29, 2020, provided that the Company may further extend such date for an additional
30 days (the “Extended Date”). The Trust Amendment was approved by the Company’s stockholders at a Special Meeting
of Stockholders held on January 24, 2020 (the “Special Meeting”).

 

The foregoing description
of the Trust Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Trust
Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

 

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws;
Change in Fiscal Year. 

On January 24, 2020,
the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to
the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as previously amended, pursuant to which the date by which
the Company must consummate its initial business combination was extended from January 29, 2020 to the Extended Date (the “Extension”).
The Extension Amendment was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting and became effective upon the filing
thereof with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

The foregoing description
of the Extension Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
Extension Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.07 Submission of Matters
to a Vote of Security Holders. 

The results of voting
on the proposals submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting, held on January 24, 2020, were
as follows:

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

 

In connection with
the Extension, stockholders elected to redeem 3,011,003 shares of the Company’s common stock issued in the IPO, par value
$0.0001 per share (the “public shares”). As a result, an aggregate of $31,975,073.36 (or approximately $10.61 per share)
will be removed from the Company’s trust account to pay such stockholders. Following such redemptions, approximately 8,042,536
public shares will remain issued and outstanding.

 

As indicated in
the Company’s proxy materials relating to the Special Meeting, since the Extension Amendment was approved, the Company’s
sponsor has agreed to contribute to the Company as a loan $0.033 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with
the stockholder vote to approve the extension of the deadline to complete an initial business combination to February 29, 2020,
plus, $0.033 for each public share that is not redeemed if the Company elects to further extend the deadline to complete a business
combination beyond February 29, 2020 for an additional 30 days. The Company intends to use the amounts loaned by the sponsor to
deposit in the Company’s trust account. Accordingly, the Company’s sponsor will contribute an aggregate of $265,403.69
(the “Contribution”) to the Company within two business days prior to the beginning of such 30-day period (or portion
thereof), other than the first Contribution which is being made on January 24, 2020. If the Company takes the full time through
the Extended Date to complete an initial business combination, the redemption price per share at the meeting for such business
combination or the Company’s subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.67 per share. The amount of the Contribution
will not bear interest and will be repayable by the Company to the sponsor upon consummation of an initial business combination.




     
     
    



 

The information
in this Item 7.01 is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor
shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except
as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Forward-Looking Statements

 

Certain statements made
herein are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”,
“believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “plan”, “outlook”, and “project”
and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.
Such forward-looking statements include timing of the proposed merger; the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions
of the parties once the transaction is complete, and Holding’s, the Company’s and HOFV’s estimated and future
results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth opportunities, relating
to the acquired business. These forward-looking statements reflect the current analysis of existing information and are subject
to various risks and uncertainties. As a result, caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Due to known
and unknown risks, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations or projections. The following factors, among
others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the occurrence
of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement and the proposed transaction
contemplated thereby; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement due to the failure to obtain
approval of the stockholders of the Company or other conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement; the outcome of any legal proceedings
that have been, or will be, instituted against the Company or other parties to the Merger Agreement following announcement of the
Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated therein; the ability of Holding’s to meet NASDAQ listing standards following
the merger and in connection with the consummation thereof; the failure to obtain the financing arrangements necessary to complete
the development of the project; the failure to achieve the assumptions underlying certain of the financial projections included
within the investor presentation including, among others, securing the timely financing for, and achieving construction of, the
second phase of the project within assumed time and financial budget, and achieving expected attendance and occupancy rates; risks
that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result
of the announcement of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the transaction described therein; costs related to the proposed
merger and the impact of the substantial indebtedness to be incurred to finance the consummation of the merger; changes in applicable
laws or regulations; the ability of the combined company to meet its financial and strategic goals, due to, among other things,
competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitability, maintain relationships with customers
and retain its key employees; the possibility that the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business,
and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed
from time to time in other reports and other public filings with the SEC by the Company and Holdings.

 

Participants in the Solicitation

 

The Company, Holdings,
HOFV, Newco and their respective directors, executive officers and other members of their management and employees, under SEC rules,
may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of the Company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed
business combination. Investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and
interests in the Company’s directors in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, which
was filed with the SEC on March 18, 2019, and also in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on November 12,
2019, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed with the SEC on January 23, 2020, which includes the proxy statement/prospectus of the
Company for the proposed transaction. Information regarding the persons who may, under SEC rules, be deemed participants in the
solicitation of proxies to the Company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination, and information
concerning the interests of the Company’s and Newco’s participants in the solicitation, which may, in some cases, be
different than those of the Company’s and Newco’s equity holders generally, is set forth in the Registration Statement
on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on November 12, 2019, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed with the SEC on January 23, 2020.
