On May 30, 2018, Landcadia Holdings, Inc. (the

and Class F common stock held of record as of May 10, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, were present either in person
or by proxy, which constituted a quorum. The Company’s stockholders voted on the following proposals at the special meeting,
each of which were approved. The final vote tabulation for each proposal is set forth below.

 


1.To approve and adopt an amendment to the Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend

certificate of incorporation, until the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, only holders of Class
F common stock can elect or remove directors. Therefore, only holders of Class F common stock voted on the election of directors
at the special meeting.

public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2018.

the special meeting was determined not to be necessary or appropriate.
