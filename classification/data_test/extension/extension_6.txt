Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 



Merger Agreement

 

Social Capital Hedosophia
Holdings Corp. is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting
a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses
(“SCH”). As previously disclosed in the July 9 Current Report, on July 9, 2019, SCH entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Vieco 10 Limited, a company limited by shares under the laws
of the British Virgin Islands (“V10”), Foundation Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of SCH (“Merger Sub A”), Foundation Sub 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of SCH (“Merger Sub B”), Foundation Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of SCH (“Merger Sub LLC” collectively with Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B, the “Merger
Subs”), TSC Vehicle Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of V10 (“Company
A”), Virgin Galactic Vehicle Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Holder
(“Company B”) and VGH, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the
Holder (“Company LLC” collectively with Company A and Company B, the “VG Companies” and together
with V10, “VG”).

 

The Mergers

 

The Merger Agreement
provides that, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the following transactions will occur
(together with the other agreements and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Purchase Agreement (as
defined below), the “Business Combination”):

 





(i)             at
the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, (x) in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (“DGCL”),
Merger Sub A will merge with and into Company A, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub A will cease and Company A will
be the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of SCH (“Corp Merger A”), (y) Merger Sub B, will
merge with and into Company B, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub B will cease and Company B will be the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of SCH (“Corp Merger B”) and (z) in accordance with Section 18-209
of the Delaware Limited Liability Corporation Act, as amended, Merger Sub LLC will merge with and into Company LLC, the separate
company existence of Merger Sub LLC will cease and Company LLC will be the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of
SCH (the “LLC Merger” collectively with Corp Merger A and Corp Merger B, the “Mergers”);

 

(ii)            as
a result of the Mergers, among other things, all outstanding shares of common stock or limited liability company interests, as
applicable, of each of the VG Companies will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a number of shares of SCH Common
Stock (as defined below) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $1,300,000,000 by $10.00; and

 

(iii)           upon the effective
time of the Mergers (the “Effective Time”), SCH will immediately be renamed “Virgin Galactic Holdings,
Inc.”

 





The Board of Directors
of SCH (the “Board”) has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Business
Combination and the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and
related matters by the shareholders of SCH.

 

The Domestication

 

Prior to the Closing,
subject to the approval of SCH’s shareholders, and in accordance with the DGCL, Cayman Islands Companies Law (2018 Revision)
(the “CICL”) and SCH’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (as may be amended
from time to time, the “Cayman Constitutional Documents”), SCH will effect a deregistration under the CICL and
a domestication under Section 388 of the DGCL (by means of filing a certificate of domestication (the “Certificate of
Domestication”) with the Secretary of State of Delaware), pursuant to which SCH’s jurisdiction of incorporation
will be changed from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware (the “Domestication”).

 




    2
     
    



 

In connection with
the Domestication, (i) each of the then issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of SCH (the
“SCH Class A Ordinary Shares”), will convert automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of common stock,
par value $0.0001, per share of SCH (after its Domestication) (the “SCH Common Stock”), (ii) each of the then
issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of SCH (the “SCH Class B Ordinary Shares”),
will convert automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of SCH Common Stock; provided, however, that with
respect to the SCH Class B Ordinary Shares held by the Sponsor (as defined below), in connection with the Domestication the Sponsor
will instead receive upon the conversion of the SCH Class B Ordinary Shares held by it, a number of shares of SCH Common Stock
equal to (x) the number of SCH Class B Ordinary Shares held by it as of immediately prior to the Domestication minus (y)
after giving effect to the Domestication, the number of shares of SCH Common Stock underlying the Director RSU Grants (as defined
below) that were outstanding as of immediately prior to the Domestication, (iii) each then issued and outstanding warrant of SCH
will convert automatically into a warrant to acquire one share of SCH Common Stock, pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated September
13, 2017, between SCH and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and (iv) each then issued and outstanding
unit of SCH (the “Cayman SCH Units”) will convert automatically into a unit of SCH (after the Domestication)
(the “Domesticated SCH Units”), with each Domesticated SCH Unit representing one share of SCH Common Stock and
one-third of one Domesticated SCH Warrant.

 

Conditions to Closing

 

The Merger Agreement
is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including, among others, (i) approval by SCH’s
shareholders of the Business Combination and related agreements and transactions, (ii) the effectiveness of the proxy / registration
statement on Form S-4 to be filed by SCH in connection with the Business Combination, (iii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals
(including approval for listing on the NYSE of the shares of SCH Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Mergers), (iv)
that SCH have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets upon Closing and (v) the absence of any injunctions.

 

In addition, prior
to the Closing, V10 and certain of its subsidiaries (including the VG Companies) will consummate the restructuring transactions
as set forth in Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Company A, Company B and Company LLC will become, in each case, direct wholly-owned
subsidiaries of V10 (the “Pre-Closing Restructuring”), and it is a condition to the obligations of SCH and Merger
Subs to consummate the Mergers that (i) the Pre-Closing Restructuring has been substantially completed and (ii) the VG Companies
and their subsidiaries collectively hold cash in an amount equal to or greater than $2,000,000, in the aggregate, in each case,
as of the Closing.

 

Other conditions to
V10 and the VG Companies’ obligations to consummate the Mergers include, among others, that as of the Closing, (i) the Domestication
has been completed, and (ii) the amount of cash available in the trust account into which substantially all of the proceeds of
SCH’s initial public offering and private placements of its warrants have been deposited for the benefit of SCH, certain
of its public shareholders and the underwriters of SCH’s initial public offering (the “Trust Account”),
after deducting the amount required to satisfy SCH’s obligations to its shareholders (if any) that exercise their rights
to redeem their SCH Class A Ordinary Shares (each, a “Redemption”) pursuant to the Cayman Constitutional Documents
(“Trust Amount”), is at least equal to the sum of (x) $400,000,000 plus (y) if applicable, an aggregate
of approximately $24,150,000 of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the Trust Account (the “Minimum Available
SCH Cash Amount”); provided that this condition may not be waived by V10 or the VG Companies if the Available
SCH Cash (as defined below) is less than $200,000,000 (the “Minimum SCH Cash Condition”).

 

However, if the Trust
Amount as of the Closing is less than the Minimum Available SCH Cash Amount, then (1) V10 and its affiliates will have the right
(but not the obligation) to purchase (or seek a third party to purchase) additional shares of SCH Common Stock at a price per share
of $10.00 up to the Minimum Available SCH Cash Amount less the amount of any Primary Purchase (as defined below) pursuant to clause
(2) (the “Additional V10 Equity Amount”) and (2) if the aggregate purchase price paid to SCH by the CP Holder
(as defined below) under a Primary Purchase (the “Investment Amount”, as more fully described below), when added
to the Trust Amount and the Additional V10 Equity Amount, is equal to or greater than the Minimum Available SCH Cash Amount, then
the Minimum SCH Cash Condition will be deemed to have been satisfied (the amount as calculated by adding the Trust Amount, the
Additional V10 Equity Amount and the Investment Amount, the “Available SCH Cash”).

 




    3
     
    



 

Repurchase 

 

Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, within ten business days after the Closing, if the Available SCH Cash is greater than $500,000,000 (the amount by which
the Available SCH Cash exceeds $500,000,000, the “Remaining Cash”), then SCH will, at V10’s election,
use cash in an amount up to the lesser of $200,000,000 and the Remaining Cash to repurchase shares of SCH Common Stock from V10
at a purchase price of $10.00 per share.

 

Extension

 

In connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the Cayman Constitutional Documents and the Investment
Management Trust Agreement, dated September 13, 2017 (the “Trust Agreement”), between SCH and Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee, SCH will, to the extent required under the Merger Agreement and subject to the approval
of SCH’s shareholders, amend the Cayman Constitutional Documents and the Trust Agreement to extend the period within which
SCH must have completed an initial Business Combination (as defined therein) to December 18, 2019 and, if required, to April 18,
2020 (the “Extension”).

 

Covenants

 

The Merger Agreement
contains additional covenants, including, among others, providing for (i) the parties to conduct their respective businesses in
the ordinary course through the Closing, (ii) the parties to not initiate any negotiations or enter into any agreements for certain
alternative transactions, (iii) the VG Companies to prepare and deliver to SCH certain audited and unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the VG Companies, (iv) SCH to prepare and file a proxy / registration statement on Form S-4 and take certain other
actions to obtain the requisite approval of SCH shareholders of certain proposals regarding the Business Combination (including
the Domestication and Extension), and (v) the parties to use reasonable best efforts to obtain necessary approvals from governmental
agencies.

 

In addition, the Merger
Agreement contains “wrong pockets” covenants, pursuant to which (i) V10 and its affiliates agree
to transfer to the VG Companies or a designated subsidiary, any assets or liabilities substantially exclusively used in the business
of the VG Companies and their subsidiaries as conducted on the date of the Closing (the “Closing Date”) that
were inadvertently not transferred to the VG Companies and (ii) SCH and its subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing,
the VG Companies)     agree to transfer to V10 or a designated affiliate, any asset or liability substantially
exclusively used in the business of V10 or its affiliates (other than the VG Companies or their subsidiaries) as conducted on the
Closing Date that was inadvertently transferred to the VG Companies prior to Closing. The parties further agree to reimburse one
another for certain losses actually paid by such party in respect of such “wrong pocket” liabilities, in each case,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.

 

Representations and Warranties

 

The Merger Agreement
contains customary representations and warranties by SCH, Merger Subs, V10 and the VG Companies. The representations and warranties
of the respective parties to the Merger Agreement generally will not survive the closing of the Mergers, but SCH retains the right
to pursue recoveries under any representation and warranty policy which SCH may, in its sole discretion, seek to obtain and bind
prior to the Closing.

 

Termination

 

The Merger Agreement
may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing (x) by mutual written consent of SCH and V10, (y) by V10, in the event of certain
injunctions, if certain approvals of the shareholders of SCH, to the extent required under the Merger Agreement, are not obtained
as set forth therein or if there is a Modification of Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or (z) by either SCH
or V10 in certain other circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, including in the event of certain uncured breaches by
the other party or if the Closing has not occurred on or before December 18, 2019, or if the time period for SCH to consummate a business combination is extended to April 18, 2020, the Closing has not occurred
on or before April 18, 2020 (the later of such dates, the “Agreement End Date”).

other things, the CP Holder has agreed to, concurrently with the consummation of the Mergers, at the option of V10, (i) purchase
a number of shares of newly issued SCH Common Stock from SCH in exchange for cash to be retained by SCH (the “Primary

Rights

 

The Merger Agreement
contemplates that, at the Closing, SCH, V10, the Sponsor and CP Holder will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights
Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which SCH will agree to register for resale, pursuant
to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, certain shares of SCH Common Stock and other equity securities of SCH that are held

Stock received by V10 in connection with the Business Combination, including a two-year lock-up of such shares in each case, subject
to limited exceptions as contemplated thereby (including that V10 may transfer up to 50% of the shares of SCH Common Stock received

Deed of Novation, Amendment and Restatement of Trade Mark
License



 

In connection with
the Business Combination, on July 9, 2019, Virgin Enterprises Limited (“VEL”), VG, LLC and SCH have entered
into a deed of novation, amendment and restatement (the “Novation Deed”), pursuant to which the trade mark license
agreement, dated July 15, 2009, as supplemented and amended by a letter agreement dated December 4, 2013 and amended and restated
on March 1, 2017 and further amended on May 30, 2017 (pursuant to which VEL granted VG, LLC certain rights to use certain VIRGIN
marks) (the “TMLA”), was novated to SCH, and the parties thereto have agreed to amend and restate the TMLA in
full in the form attached as an annex to the Novation Deed, with effect from and after the Effective Time (the “Amended
TMLA”). 

 

The form of Amended
TMLA, among other things, contemplates that VEL will grant to SCH (following the Domestication, referred to therein as “VGHI”),
during the term of the Amended TMLA (and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein), the right to use the Virgin brand,
name and logo in relation to the provision of orbital and sub-orbital space flight experiences to clients and certain other ancillary
activities set forth in the Amended TMLA.  Subject to certain exceptions and adjustments contained in the Amended TMLA, VGHI
will agree to pay VEL a royalty fee based on VHGI’s and its subsidaries’ gross sales.

 

The Amended TMLA also
contains, among other things, customary mutual indemnity provisions, representations and warranties, information rights of VEL
and restrictions on VGHI’s and its affiliates’ ability to apply for or obtain registration for any confusingly similar
intellectual property to that licensed to VGHI pursuant to the Amended TMLA. The Amended TMLA has an initial term of 25 years,
subject to renewal for up to two additional ten year periods or earlier termination as set forth in the Amended TMLA.



 

2019 Incentive Award Plan and
Director RSU Grants

 



In addition, as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on July 8, 2019, the Board of Directors of SCH adopted the 2019 Incentive Award Plan
(the “Plan”). The aggregate number of shares of SCH Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the Plan
will be equal to (i) ten percent of the sum of (x) issued and outstanding shares of SCH Common Stock as of the Closing plus
(y) the number of shares of SCH Common Stock covered by the Director RSU Grants as of immediately prior to the Closing, plus
(ii) the number of shares of SCH Common Stock covered by the Director RSU Grants as of immediately prior to the Closing. The
Plan’s purpose is to enhance the ability of SCH to attract, retain and motivate those individuals who make important
contributions to SCH and the VG Companies after the Closing by providing equity ownership opportunities and/or equity-linked
compensatory opportunities.  The Plan is subject to, and contingent upon, approval of the SCH’s shareholders.

 

Contemporaneous with
the execution of the Merger Agreement and the adoption of the Plan, the Board approved a grant of restricted stock units pursuant
to the Plan (“Director RSU Grants”) to certain members of the Board that, at the Closing, will vest and be converted
into the right to receive an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of SCH Common Stock. The Director RSU Grants are subject to, and contingent
upon, (i) the closing of the Mergers, (ii) approval of the Plan by SCH’s shareholders, (iii) the event described under “The
Domestication” above, including the reduction in the number of shares of SCH Common Stock to be received by the Sponsor in
the Domestication by the number of shares of SCH Common Stock underlying the Director RSU Grants that were outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Domestication, (iv) the continued service of the respective participants on the Board through the Closing Date, and
(v) the accuracy and completeness of the participant’s representations and warranties in connection with the award grant.
The restricted stock units will not settle in to shares of SCH Common Stock until a date selected by SCH that occurs between January
1 and December 31st of the year following the Closing.

Agreement, Purchase Agreement and Sponsor Support Agreement, and the transactions and documents contemplated thereby is not complete
and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the Sponsor Support
Agreement, copies of which are filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 2.1, Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively,

the forward-looking statements in this document, including but not limited to: (i) the risk that the transaction may not be
completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of SCH’s securities, (ii) the risk that
the transaction may not be completed by SCH’s business combination deadline and the potential failure to obtain an
extension of the business combination deadline if sought by SCH, (iii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the
consummation of the transaction, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of SCH, the satisfaction
of the minimum trust account amount following redemptions by SCH’s public shareholders and the receipt of certain
governmental and regulatory approvals, (iv) the lack of a third party valuation in determining whether or not to pursue the
proposed transaction, (v) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the
termination of the Merger Agreement, (vi) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transaction on VG’s
business relationships, operating results, and business generally, (vii) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current
plans and operations of VG, (viii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against VG or against SCH
related to the Merger Agreement or the proposed transaction, (ix) the ability to maintain the listing of SCH’s
securities on the New York Stock Exchange, (x) changes in the competitive and highly regulated industries in which VG plans
to operate, variations in operating performance across competitors, changes in laws and regulations affecting VG’s
business and changes in the combined capital structure, (xi) the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other
expectations after the completion of the proposed transaction, and identify and realize additional opportunities, and (xii)
the risk of downturns in the highly competitive and novel tourist spaceflight industry. The foregoing list of factors is not
exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the
“Risk Factors” section of SCH’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the
registration statement on Form S-4 discussed above and other documents filed by SCH from time to time with the SEC. These
filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ
materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they
are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and VG and SCH assume no obligation
and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events, or otherwise. Neither VG nor SCH gives any assurance that either VG or SCH will achieve its expectations.
