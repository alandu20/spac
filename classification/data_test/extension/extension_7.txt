 Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

Amendment to Investment Management Trust Agreement 

 

On July 26, 2019, Gordon Pointe Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”) entered into
Amendment No. 1 to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2018, by and between the Company and
Continental (the “Trust Amendment”), pursuant to which the date on which Continental must liquidate the trust account
which was established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO”), in the event the
Company has not consummated its initial business combination, was extended from July 30, 2019 to October 31, 2019, provided that
the Company may further extend such date up to three times, each by an additional 30 days (the “Extended Date”). The
Trust Amendment was approved by the Company’s stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on July 26, 2019 (the
“Special Meeting”).

 

The foregoing description of the Trust Amendment
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Trust Amendment, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

 

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws;
Change in Fiscal Year. 

On July 26, 2019, the Company filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, pursuant to which the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business
combination was extended from July 30, 2019 to the Extended Date (the “Extension”). The Extension Amendment was approved
by the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting and became effective upon the filing thereof with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware.

The foregoing description of the Extension
Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Extension Amendment,
a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
Holders. 

The results of voting on the proposals
submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting, held on July 26, 2019, were as follows:

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

In connection with the Extension, stockholders
elected to redeem 1,446,461 shares of the Company’s common stock issued in the IPO, par value $0.0001 per share (the “public
shares”). As a result, an aggregate of approximately $14,962,644.55 (or approximately $10.34 per share) will be removed from
the Company’s trust account to pay such stockholders. Following such redemptions, approximately 11,053,539 public shares
will remain issued and outstanding.

As indicated in the Company’s proxy
materials relating to the Special Meeting, since the Extension Amendment was approved, the Company’s sponsor has agreed to
contribute to the Company as a loan $0.10 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the stockholder vote to
approve the extension of the deadline to complete an initial business combination to October 31, 2019, plus, if the Company elects
to further extend the deadline to complete an initial business combination beyond October 31, 2019, $0.033 for each 30-day period
thereafter, or portion thereof, up to three additional 30-day periods. The Company intends to use the amounts loaned by the sponsor
to deposit in the Company’s trust account. Accordingly, the Company’s sponsor will contribute an aggregate of approximately
$1,105,353.90 (the “Contribution”) to the Company within two business days prior to the beginning of each 30-day period
(or portion thereof), other than the first Contribution which is being made on July 26, 2019. If the Company takes the full time
through the Extended Date to complete an initial business combination, the redemption price per share at the meeting for such business
combination or the Company’s subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.52 per share. The amount of the Contribution
will not bear interest and will be repayable by the Company to the sponsor upon consummation of an initial business combination.

The information in this Item 7.01 is
being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated
by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by
specific reference in such filing.
