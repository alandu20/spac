Item 5.07.	Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
Holders.

On July 31, 2019,
Pensare Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Meeting”). At the
Meeting, the stockholders approved an amendment (the “Charter Amendment”) to the Company’s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination (the “Extension”)
for an additional four months, from August 1, 2019 to December 1, 2019. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock was required to approve the Charter Amendment. The purpose of the Charter Amendment
is to allow the Company more time to complete its proposed business combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement,
dated as of July 24, 2019, by and among the Company, Tango Merger Sub Corp., Stratos Management Systems, Inc., and Stratos Management
Systems Holdings, LLC. Following redemptions of 5,754,273 of the shares of Company’s common stock in connection with the
Extension, a total of approximately $3.2 million will remain in the Company’s trust account.

Set forth below
are the final voting results for the Charter Amendment proposal:
