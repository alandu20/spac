    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.





 

On July 9, 2019, Black
Ridge Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “Meeting”).
At the Meeting, the Company’s stockholders considered the following proposal:

 

1.                 
A proposal to adopt and approve an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the
“charter”) to extend the date that the Company has to consummate a business combination (the “Extension”)
to August 10, 2019. The following is a tabulation of the votes with respect to this proposal, which was approved by the Company’s
stockholders:

 



    For
    Against
    Abstain
    Broker Non-Votes

    12,312,704
    2,170,573
    200,000
    0

 

In connection with this vote, the holders of 9,246,727
shares of the Company’s common stock properly exercised their right to convert their shares into cash at a conversion
price of approximately $10.29 per share. In connection with the Extension, Black Ridge Oil & Gas, Inc., the
Company’s sponsor, loaned $30,000 to the Company to be placed in trust for the benefit of the public shares that were
not converted. The loan is non-interest bearing and is evidenced by a promissory note issued by the Company on the same date.

 

The Company filed the amendment to the
charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 9, 2019.
