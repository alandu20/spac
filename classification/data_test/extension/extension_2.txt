Item
5.07.     Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

 

On
April 29, 2019, Pensare Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Meeting”).
At the Meeting, the stockholders approved an amendment (the “Charter Amendment”) to the Company’s amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination (the “Extension”)
for an additional three months, from May 1, 2019 to August 1, 2019. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock was required to approve the Charter Amendment. The purpose of the Charter Amendment
is to allow the Company more time to complete its proposed business combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement,
dated as of January 31, 2019, by and among the Company, Tango Merger Sub Corp. and U.S. TelePacific Holdings Corp. Following redemptions
of 3,831,985 of the shares of Company’s common stock in connection with the Extension, a total of approximately $252.2
million will remain in the Company’s trust account.

 

Set
forth below are the final voting results for the Charter Amendment proposal:
