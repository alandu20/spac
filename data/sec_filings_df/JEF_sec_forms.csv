ratio will be decreased to equal the quotient (rounded to the nearest 0.0001) obtained by dividing (i) $42.00 by (ii) the average jefferies stock price (the exchange ratio). in the event that neither an election for stock consideration nor cash consideration has properly been made with respect to shares of homefed common stock, then (x) if the average jefferies stock price is greater than $19.00, such shares shall be treated as if an election for stock consideration had been made with respect thereto and (y) if the average jefferies stock price is less than or equal to $19.00, such shares shall be treated as if an election for cash consideration had been made with respect thereto. on a date to be announced, homefed stockholders will be asked to vote on the adoption of the merger

homefed common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting and (ii) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of homefed common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting not owned, directly or indirectly, by (x) jefferies or any of its affiliates or (y) any director of homefed who is a director or employee of jefferies or any section 16 officer (pursuant to rule 16a-1(f) of the exchange act) of homefed (such holders, the public stockholders) at the special meeting of homefed stockholders in connection with the merger (collectively, the requisite stockholder approvals). the merger agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions with respect to unsolicited proposals, homefed will not, and will cause its and the homefed subsidiaries directors, officers and employees not to, and will instruct its representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit acquisition proposals or participate in any discussions concerning, or provide non-public information concerning homefed or any of its subsidiaries in connection with any acquisition proposal. however, prior to the receipt of the requisite stockholder approvals, the board of directors of homefed (the homefed board), upon recommendation of the special committee of independent and disinterested directors of homefed who are not affiliated with jefferies (the special committee), may, subject to certain conditions, change its recommendation in favor of approval of the merger agreement, if and only if, in connection with the receipt of a superior proposal or occurrence of an intervening event, it determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to make such change in recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the public stockholders, under applicable law. the completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including: (i) receipt of the requisite stockholder approvals (which condition is not waivable), (ii) receipt of approval for listing on the nyse of shares of jefferies common stock issuable as merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement and jefferies common stock to be issued under jefferies equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement, (iii) the absence of any applicable law or order that prohibits completion of the merger, (iv) the registration statement on form s-4 (the form s-4) filed by jefferies, being declared effective by the securities and exchange commission (the sec), (v) receipt by jefferies of a written tax opinion from weil, gotshal & manges llp, that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the internal revenue code, (vi) performance in all material respects of the obligations required to be performed by the other party pursuant to the merger agreement at or prior to the completion of the merger and (vii) the accuracy of certain representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality qualifications. the merger agreement also contains customary pre-closing covenants, including the obligation of homefed and each of its subsidiaries to conduct its businesses in the ordinary course in a manner consistent with past practice and to refrain from taking specified actions without the consent of jefferies. none of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement survives the effective time contemplated by the merger agreement. the merger agreement contains customary termination rights for both homefed and jefferies, subject to certain conditions, including (i) by mutual written consent, (ii) failure to complete the merger by october 12, 2019 or (iii) if the homefed requisite stockholder approvals are not obtained. following the merger, shares of homefed common stock will no longer be quoted on the otcqb marketplace, there will be no public market for shares homefed common stock, and registration of shares homefed common stock under the securities exchange act of 1934 will be terminated. the foregoing summary of the merger agreement and the

covered shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement. the voting agreement will terminate automatically upon the earliest to occur of (i) the effective time, (ii) the valid termination of the merger agreement, (iii) a change in recommendation by the

an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to section 13(a) of the exchange act. ☐ item 5.02. compensatory arrangements of certain officers. the compensation committee of the leucadia board of directors approved an executive compensation plan (the plan) that extends leucadias current compensation plans for rich handler, our ceo, and brian friedman, our president (together, our executives), for compensation years 2018, 2019 and 2020. upon final approval on january 1, 2018, the plan will take effect and the long-term equity compensation component will be granted. to receive targeted long-term compensation, our executives will have to achieve at least 8% growth on an annual and multi-year compounded basis in leucadias total shareholder return (tsr) or leucadias return on tangible deployable equity (rotde) during the five-year period from 2018 through 2022. if tsr and rotde are less than 5% (increased from the 4% threshold used in 2016 and 2017), our executives will receive no long-term compensation. tsr and rotde are the same performance metrics currently in use in respect of 2016 and 2017. with the exception of base salaries, the plan is 100% performance-based. tsr is the annualized rate of return reflecting price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends and distributions to shareholders and the compounding effect of dividends paid and distributions on reinvested dividends and distributions over each measurement period. rotde is net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets divided by tangible book value at the beginning of the year adjusted for intangible assets and deferred tax assets. the compensation committee selected the plans performance criteria and payment and vesting thresholds after taking into account, among other things, leucadias performance, the long-term nature of our strategy, our shareholders feedback, compensation paid by leucadias peers, the annual compensation that had historically been awarded to our executives at leucadia and jefferies, our experience to date under the 2016 and 2017 executive compensation plans, the multiple roles filled by our executives, the potential alternative employment opportunities available to our executives, and that our executives do not have and have never had employment or severance agreements. as was the case in 2016 and in 2017, the compensation committee has targeted annual long-term compensation of $25 million under the plan, which achieves the compensation committees goal of targeting our executives compensation at or below median compensation levels of peer-firm executives. after two years of all-equity compensation plans, with no short- or long-term cash component, our compensation committee decided to introduce long-term cash as a component of the plan. accordingly, the targeted annual long-term compensation will be divided between $9 million in long-term cash and $16 million in long-term equity, both of which will remain subject to performance targets over the three-year measurement period for each compensation year. in each of the three years of the compensation years three-year measurement period, if our executives meet performance targets, each is eligible to be paid one-third (or $3 million) of the long-term cash or bank one-third (or $5.3 million) of the long-term equity, which will be in the form of restricted stock units (rsus). the plan will have the following performance conditions:  performance metrics: long-term cash compensation under the plan will be based upon the compound growth rates of leucadias rotde, and long-term equity compensation under the plan will be based upon the compound growth rates of leucadias tsr, which will be measured from the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of december in the year preceding the reference compensation year. for both rotde and tsr, the annual, two- and three-year results will be used to determine payments and vesting for each compensation year.  performance targets and thresholds:  long-term cash: if leucadias rotde is less than 5%, our executives will not receive any long-term cash compensation. if leucadias rotde is between 5% and 8% on average over the three-year measurement period, each of our executives will be eligible to receive long-term cash compensation of between $4.5 million and $9 million. if rotde is greater than 8%, each of our executives is eligible to receive up to an additional 50% in long-term cash compensation on a pro rata basis up to 12%.  long-term equity: if leucadias tsr is less than 5%, our executives will not receive any long-term equity compensation. if leucadias tsr is between 5% and 8% on a compounded basis over the three-year measurement period, each of our executives will be eligible to receive long-term equity compensation of between $8 million and $16 million in rsus. if tsr is greater than 8%, our executives are eligible to receive up to an additional 50% in long-term equity compensation on a pro rata basis up to 12%. no additional long-term cash or long-term equity compensation will be awarded for tsr or rotde exceeding 12%.  performance vesting mechanism: although long-term compensation will not be paid in full for cash or vest for rsus until after three years from the beginning of the reference compensation year, portions of the overall awards may be paid in cash or banked via rsus for each executive based upon each measurement periods tsr and rotde (for example, for compensation year 2018, if rotde for 2018 were to be 8%, each executive would be eligible to receive a $3 million cash payment, and if tsr equaled 8% in 2018, each executive would be eligible to bank one-third of targeted long-term equity compensation, but those rsus would not vest until the beginning of 2021). any rsus that have not been banked during each measurement period will remain available to vest if two- or three-year growth rates meet or exceed thresholds. the total potential vested rsus will equal the greater of (a) the sum of all banked rsus for the first two measurement periods and (b) potential vested rsus based upon the three-year growth rates.

compensation committee of the leucadia board of directors approved an executive-compensation plan (the 2017 plan) for rich handler, our ceo, and brian friedman, our president (together, our executives), for compensation year 2017 that is identical to the plan that the committee approved in 2016 and is based upon performance metrics achieved over a three-year period from 2017 through 2019. as did the 2016 plan, the 2017 plan aligns our executive compensation with the interests of our long-term shareholders. with the exception of base salaries, the 2017 plan is 100% performance based. the compensation committee determined to eliminate cash incentive bonuses for 2017 as it did in 2016. 100% of each of our ceo and presidents 2017 compensation beyond their base salaries will be composed entirely of performance-based restricted stock units (rsus) to be granted in january 2017 that will vest at the beginning of 2020. to further align executive compensation with shareholder interests, any vested rsus will be subject to a post-vesting, three-year holding period such that no vested rsus can be sold or transferred until january 2023. the compensation committee selected the 2017 plans performance criteria and vesting thresholds after taking into account, among other things, leucadias performance, the long-term nature of the companys strategy, our shareholders feedback, leucadias peers, the annual cash incentive and long-term equity grants that had historically been awarded to our executives at leucadia and jefferies, the multiple roles fulfilled by our executives, and that our executives do not have and have never had employment or severance agreements. when finally approved and granted in january 2017, the rsus will have the following performance conditions and required holding period:  performance metrics: the equity incentive under the plan will be based equally on the compound growth rates of leucadias total shareholder return (tsr), which will be measured from the close on the last trading day of december 2016 and leucadias return on tangible deployable equity (rotde), the annual, two- and three-year results of which will be used to determine vesting. tsr is the annualized rate of return reflecting price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends and distributions to shareholders and the compounding effect of dividends paid and distributions on reinvested dividends and distributions over each measurement period. rotde is net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets divided by tangible book value at the beginning of the year adjusted for intangible assets and deferred tax assets. rotde, an adjusted return-on-equity measurement, was chosen to appropriately measure our executives performance against the actual tangible equity that is or can be allocated and invested, and from which earnings can be generated.  performance targets and thresholds: if leucadias tsr and rotde annual growth rates are less than 4%, our executives will not receive any 2017 incentive compensation. if leucadias tsr and rotde both grow by between 4% and 8% on a compounded basis over the three-year measurement period, each of our executives will be eligible to receive 2017 incentive compensation of between $12.5 million and $25 million in rsus. if tsr and rotde growth rates are greater than 8%, our executives are eligible to receive up to an additional 50% in incentive compensation on a pro rata basis up to 12% growth rates. no additional incentive compensation will be awarded for tsr or rotde growth rates exceeding 12%.  weighting: when determining whether rsus will vest, the calculation will be weighted equally between tsr and rotde. for example, if tsr growth was below minimum thresholds, but rotde growth was above minimum thresholds, our executives would still be eligible to receive some number of vested rsus based on rotde growth.  performance vesting mechanism: although no rsus will vest until the beginning of 2020, portions of the overall awards may be banked for each executive each year based upon that years tsr and rotde growth (for example, if growth rates in both tsr and rotde equaled 8% in 2017, our executives would be eligible to bank one-third of their targeted incentive compensation, but those rsus would not vest until the beginning of 2020). any rsus that have not been banked during each measuring period over 2017 and 2018 will remain available to vest if two- or three-year growth rates meet or exceed thresholds. the total potential vested rsus will equal the greater of (a) the sum of all banked rsus for each of 2017 and 2018 and (b) potential vested rsus based upon the three-year growth rates.  holding period mandates no sales or transfers for six years until 2023: rsus will not be eligible to vest until the beginning of 2020 and will be subject to forfeiture if the executive resigns or is terminated for cause. our executives cannot sell or otherwise transfer vested rsus until january 2023. signatures pursuant to the requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the

compensation committee of the leucadia board of directors today approved an executive-compensation plan (the plan) for rich handler, our ceo, and brian friedman, our president (together, our executives), for compensation year 2016 that will be based upon performance metrics achieved over a three-year period from 2016 through 2018. based on the changes to our business in recent years and as a result of feedback we received from our shareholders, including our most recent round of engagement that focused almost exclusively on our compensation program, the compensation committee adopted the plan to further align our executive compensation with the interests of our long-term shareholders. as has historically been the case, including in 2015 when the companys performance resulted in approximately a 36% reduction in overall compensation to our executives, with the exception of base salaries, the 2016 executive-compensation plan is 100% performance based. the compensation committee determined to eliminate cash incentive bonuses for 2016 and that 100% of each of our ceo and presidents 2016 compensation beyond their base salaries will be composed entirely of performance-based restricted stock units (rsus) that will vest at the end of 2018. to further align executive compensation with shareholder interests, any vested rsus will be subject to a post-vesting, three-year holding period such that no vested rsus can be sold or transferred until january 2022. the compensation committee selected the plans performance criteria and vesting thresholds after taking into account, among other things, leucadias performance, the long-term nature of the companys strategy, our shareholders feedback, leucadias peers, the annual cash incentive and long-term equity grants that had historically been awarded to our executives at leucadia and jefferies, the multiple roles fulfilled by our executives, and that our executives do not have and have never had employment or severance agreements.  performance metrics: the equity incentive under the plan will be based equally on the growth rates of leucadias total shareholder return (tsr), which will be measured from the december 31, 2015 stock price of $17.39, and leucadias return on tangible deployable equity (rotde), the annual and three-year results of which will be used to determine vesting. tsr is the annualized rate of return reflecting price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends and distributions to shareholders and the compounding effect of dividends paid and distributions on reinvested dividends and distributions over each measurement period. rotde is net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets divided by tangible book value at the beginning of the year adjusted for intangible assets (primarily the goodwill resulting from our 2013 combination with jefferies group llc) and deferred tax assets. rotde, an adjusted return-on-equity measurement, was chosen to appropriately measure our executives performance against the actual tangible equity that is or can be allocated and invested, and from which earnings can be generated.  performance targets and thresholds: if leucadias tsr and rotde annual growth rates are less than 4%, our executives will not receive any 2016 incentive compensation. if leucadias tsr and rotde both grow by between 4% and 8% on a compounded basis over the three-year measurement period, each of our executives will be eligible to receive 2016 incentive compensation of between $12.5 million and $25 million in rsus. this incentive compensation level is intended to place our executives in the median range among leucadias peers (at approximately the 50th percentile level). three-year annual growth rates of 8% in rotde would increase tangible equity by approximately $1.6 billion; and three-year annual growth rates of 8% in tsr would result in aggregate share-price appreciation of approximately $1.6 billion. if tsr and rotde growth rates are greater than 8%, our executives are eligible to receive up to an additional 50% in incentive compensation on a pro rata basis up to 12% growth rates. no additional incentive compensation will be awarded for tsr or rotde growth rates exceeding 12%.  weighting: when determining whether rsus will vest, the calculation will be weighted equally between tsr and rotde. for example, if tsr growth was below minimum thresholds, but rotde growth was above minimum thresholds, our executives would still be eligible to receive some number of vested rsus based on rotde growth.  performance vesting mechanism: although no rsus will vest until the end of 2018, portions of the overall awards may be banked for each executive each year based upon that years tsr and rotde growth (for example, if growth rates in both tsr and rotde equaled 8% in 2016, our executives would be eligible to bank one-third of their targeted incentive compensation, but those rsus would not vest until the end of 2018). any rsus that have not been banked during each annual measuring period over 2016, 2017 and 2018 will remain available to vest if three-year growth rates meet or exceed thresholds. the total potential vested rsus will equal the greater of (a) the sum of all banked rsus for each of 2016, 2017, and 2018 and (b) potential vested rsus based upon the three-year growth rates.  holding period mandates no sales or transfers for six years until 2022: rsus will not be eligible to vest until the end of 2018 and will be subject to forfeiture if the executive resigns or is terminated for cause. our executives cannot sell or otherwise transfer vested rsus until january 1, 2022. signatures pursuant to the requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the registrant
