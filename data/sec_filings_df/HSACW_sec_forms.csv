(immunovant) issued a press release and held a conference call announcing topline results from its ascend mg trial. a copy of the press release and the presentation discussed on the conference call are attached hereto as exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. the information furnished under this item 7.01, including exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, shall not be deemed filed for purposes of section 18 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or subject to the liabilities of that section. the information shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any other filing with the securities and exchange commission (the sec) made by immunovant, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. item 8.01 other events. on august 25, 2020, immunovant issued a press release announcing topline results from its ascend mg trial. the ascend mg trial is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of imvt-1401 in patients with moderate-to-severe generalized myasthenia gravis (mg). results from the six-week treatment period included three arms: 340 mg imvt-1401 weekly (n=5), 680 mg imvt-1401 weekly (n=5), and placebo (n=5). initially, the trial had a target enrollment of 21 patients, however, after taking into consideration the impact of covid-19 as well as recent data from other anti-fcrn programs that have validated this mechanism in mg, immunovant elected to unblind and report the study with 15 patients enrolled. as evaluated in a pre-specified, pooled analysis of 15 patients who completed day 42, imvt-1401-treated patients (n =10) showed a mean 3.8-point improvement on the mg activities of daily living (mg-adl) scale vs. a mean decline of +0.6 for placebo, a result that was statistically significant (p = 0.029). imvt-1401-treated patients also showed a highly statistically significant improvement on the mg composite (mgc) scale, with an average improvement of 8.0 points vs. a mean decline of +1.4 for placebo (p = 0.006). mg-adl responder rates, defined as the percentage of patients showing a > 2-point improvement, were 60% for imvt-1401-treated patients vs. 20% for placebo. mg-adl deep responder rates, defined in the study as the percentage of patients showing a > 6-point improvement, were 40% for imvt-1401-treated patients vs. 0% for placebo. mgc deep responder rates, defined in the study as the percentage of patients showing a > 10-point improvement, were 40% for imvt-1401-treated patients vs. 0% for placebo. consistent with previously reported phase 1 results, imvt-1401 was observed to be well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported, no withdrawals due to adverse events, and no imbalance in headaches. mean reductions in total serum igg from baseline to day 42 for the 340 mg and 680 mg cohorts were 59% and 76%, respectively. in addition, immunovant has updated its anticipated clinical development timelines. immunovant anticipates initiating its phase 3 clinical trial of imvt-1401 in patients with mg in the first half of calendar year 2021. immunovant currently remains on track to report initial results from its ascend go-2 trial, a phase 2b clinical trial of imvt-1401 for thyroid eye disease in the united states, canada and europe, in the first half of calendar year 2021. immunovant plans to report initial results from the high-dose cohort of its phase 2a trial of imvt-1401 in patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the first quarter of calendar year 2021. immunovant intends to announce three new indications over the next 12 months. this current report on form 8-k contains forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. the use of words such as may, might, will, would, should, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. for example, all statements immunovant makes regarding the timing, progress and reporting of results of its clinical programs and the timing of the announcement of future indications are forward-looking. all forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions by immunovants management that, although immunovant believes to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain. all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that immunovant expected. such risks and uncertainties include, among others, initial results or other preliminary analyses or results of early clinical trials may not be predictive of final trial results or of the results of later clinical trials; future clinical trials may not confirm any safety, potency or other product characteristics described or assumed in this current report on form 8-k; any product candidates that immunovant develops may not progress through clinical development or receive required regulatory approvals within expected timelines or at all; immunovants product candidates may not be beneficial to patients, or even if approved by regulatory authorities, successfully commercialized; the potential impact of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic on immunovants clinical development plans and timelines; immunovants business is heavily dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of its sole product candidate, imvt-1401; and immunovant will require additional capital to fund its operations and advance imvt-1401 through clinical development. these and other risks and uncertainties are more fully described in immunovants periodic and other reports filed with the sec, including in the section titled risk factors in immunovants most recent quarterly report on form 10-q filed with the sec on august 12, 2020, and immunovants subsequent filings with the sec. any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it was made. immunovant undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

the continued development of immunovant’s product candidates; immunovant’s scientific approach and general development progress; and the potential impact of the recent covid-19 pandemic on immunovant’s clinical development plans and timelines. these statements are also subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties that are described under the section titled “risk factors” in immunovant’s form 10-q filed with the securities and exchange commission (sec) on february 14, 2020, and immunovant’s subsequent filings with the sec. any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it was made. immunovant undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

transactions, there were 56,455,376 shares of our common stock, 10,000 shares of our series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase 5,750,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination, two promissory notes, one held by each of rtw master fund, ltd. and rtw innovation master fund, ltd., were automatically converted into shares of isls common stock exchangeable for an aggregate of 2,250,000 shares of hsacs common stock upon the closing. all interest under the promissory notes was waived and cancelled immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination. upon the closing, the sellers sold to hsac, and hsac purchased from the sellers, all of the issued and outstanding shares and other equity interests in and of isl, and hsac issued 42,090,376 of its shares to the sellers, including 10,000 shares of series a preferred stock of hsac issued to roivant. the issuance of shares of hsac to the sellers was consummated on a private placement basis, pursuant to section 4(a)(2) of the securities act. all vested or unvested outstanding options in isl under its equity incentive plan were automatically assumed by hsac and converted into options to purchase 4,408,287 shares of our common stock with no substantial changes to their vesting conditions. on december 19, 2019, our common stock, units and warrants began trading on the nasdaq stock market (nasdaq) under the symbols imvt, imvtu and imvtw, respectively. upon the closing, entities affiliated with roivant beneficially owned approximately 66.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock and the securityholders of hsac prior to the closing beneficially owned approximately 25.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. as a result, 2 we are a controlled company within the meaning of the nasdaq listing rules and we intend to take advantage of certain rules that provide exemptions from certain corporate governance rules of nasdaq applicable to listed companies. hsacs trust account had a balance immediately prior to the closing of approximately $116.5 million, prior to the payment of transaction expenses. in addition, approximately $0.8 million remained in hsacs operating account immediately prior to the closing, which, together with approximately $14.7 million of cash of isl, is

of our common stock upon the closing of the business combination by:  each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common upon the closing of the business combination;  each of our executive officers and directors; and  all of our executive officers and directors as a group upon the closing of the business combination. beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the commission, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he, she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days. this table is based upon information supplied by officers, directors and principal stockholders and schedules 13g filed with the commission. unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of our common stock beneficially owned by them. applicable percentages are based on 56,455,376 shares of common stock outstanding on december 18, 2019, adjusted as required by rules promulgated by the commission. name and address of beneficial owner(1) number of shares % of class roivant sciences ltd.(2) 37,404,967 66.3 % rtw

(2) excludes 10,000 shares of series a preferred stock issued to roivant upon closing. each share of series a preferred stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of common stock. roivant owns all of the authorized and outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, and is entitled to elect a specified number of directors to the combined companys board of directors. sakshi chhabra, andrew lo, patrick machado, keith manchester, m.d., ilan oren and vivek ramaswamy are the members of the board of directors of roivant and may be deemed to have shared voting, investment and dispositive power with respect to the shares held by this entity. these individuals disclaim beneficial ownership with respect to such shares except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein. the principal business address of roivant is suite 1, 3rd floor, 11-12 st. jamess square, london sw1y 4lb, united kingdom. (3) consists of shares owned by rtw master fund, ltd. and rtw innovation master fund, ltd. roderick wong m.d. has voting and dispositive power over the shares owned by the rtw entities. (4) hsacs sponsor is governed by a board of directors consisting of three directors: roderick wong, m.d., naveen yalamanchi, m.d., and alice lee. each director has one vote, and the approval of a majority of the directors is required to approve an action of hsac sponsor. under the so-called rule of three, if voting and dispositive decisions regarding an entitys securities are made by three or more individuals, and a voting or dispositive decision requires the approval of a majority of those individuals, then none of the individuals is deemed a beneficial owner of the entitys securities. based upon the foregoing analysis, no director of hsacs sponsor exercises voting or dispositive control over any of the securities held by hsac sponsor, even those in which he or she directly holds a pecuniary interest. accordingly, none of them will be deemed to have or share beneficial ownership of such shares. directors and executive officers our directors and executive officers after the closing are described in the proxy statement in the section titled directors, executive officers, executive compensation and corporate governance and such description is incorporated herein by reference. executive compensation the executive compensation of our executive officers and directors is described in the proxy statement in the section titled directors,

operating results or financial condition. market price of and dividends on the registrants common equity and related stockholder matters on december 19, 2019, our common stock, units and warrants began trading on the nasdaq under the symbols imvt, imvtu and imvtw, respectively. we have not paid any cash dividends on shares of our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends. the payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition. the payment of any dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors. it is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our board of directors does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. 6 information regarding hsacs common stock, rights and units and related stockholder matters are described in the
