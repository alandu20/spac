filing this current report on form 8-k with the securities and exchange commission (the “sec”) to avail ourselves of an extension of time to file our quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended march 31, 2020 (the “quarterly report”), originally due by may 15, 2020. on march 4, 2020, the sec issued an order (release no. 34-88318) under section 36 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the “exchange act”), granting exemptions from specified provisions of the exchange act and certain rules thereunder. on march 25, 2020, the order was modified and superseded by a new sec order (release no. 34-88465) (the “sec order”), that provides conditional relief to public companies that are unable to timely comply with their filing obligations as a result of the outbreak and spread of the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic (“covid-19”).the company has experienced significant disruptions to our business and operations due to circumstances related to covid-19. in particular, as a result of covid-19, we are currently experiencing the closure of our offices due to “lock-down” or “stay at home” orders implemented in response to the covid-19 pandemic and material reductions in personnel, and we have implemented remote working arrangements that have resulted in delays in our accounting and control procedures. in addition, the disruptions to our business caused by covid-19 have resulted in a significant diversion of resources to attend to the operational needs of the business. as a result, we will require additional time to prepare and finalize our quarterly report due to circumstances related to covid-19.we presently intend to file the quarterly report as soon as possible, but no later than june 29, 2020, which is 45 days from the quarterly report’s original filing deadline of may 15, 2020.in addition, in light of ongoing developments related to covid-19, we are supplementing the risk factors previously disclosed under part i, item 1a, “risk factors” of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, with the following risk factors:the current outbreak of covid-19 has adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations and is likely to have a continuing adverse impact for a significant period of time. the covid-19 pandemic has caused a rapid and precipitous drop in demand for oil, which in turn has caused oil prices to plummet since the first week of march 2020, negatively affecting the company’s cash flow, liquidity and financial position. moreover, the uncertainty about the duration of the covid-19 pandemic has caused storage constraints in the united states resulting from over-supply of produced oil, which is expected to significantly decrease our realized oil prices in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially beyond. oil prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of these events and the ongoing covid-19 outbreak, and as changes in oil inventories, oil demand and economic performance are reported. we cannot predict when oil prices will improve and stabilize. the current pandemic and uncertainty about its length and depth in future periods has caused the realized oil prices we have received since february 2020 to be significantly reduced, adversely affecting our operating cash flow and liquidity. we expect this to continue until commodity prices recover, the timing and extent of which is uncertain. as a result of the depressed pricing environment, we have halted our drilling and completion activities for the remainder of 2020, which will continue to adversely impact production throughout 2020. while we continue to flexibly manage our operations, including capital expenditure levels, based on existing and expected market conditions, our lower levels of cash flow could affect our borrowing capacity and may require us to shut-in production that has become uneconomic. these conditions have also increased the difficulty in repaying, refinancing or restructuring our long-term debt and complying with our covenants in our debt agreements. for example, our failure to provide financial statements for the quarter ended march 31, 2020 by may 15, 2020 will constitute a default under our credit agreement and an event of default if not cured within 30 days thereafter. please read the risk factor titled “if we are unable to comply with restrictions and covenants in our amended and restated credit agreement or note purchase agreement, there could be a default under the terms of the agreements, which could result in termination of the commitments, foreclosure by our lenders or second lien holders or an acceleration of payments of funds that we have borrowed. the class a common stock may not receive any value in such a scenario” under item 1a of part 1 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019 for more information about the consequences of such a default and event of default. the covid-19 pandemic and its impact is rapidly evolving, and the ultimate impact of this pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. the extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the situation, how the pandemic and measures taken in response to it impact demand for oil, the availability of personnel, equipment and services critical to our ability to operate our properties, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, each of which is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. there can be no assurance we will complete a consensual restructuring or that we would realize expected benefits from any such restructuring, if completed. if we are unable to successfully complete a consensual out of court restructuring, we may seek protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.as previously reported in the current report on form 8-k filed may 5, 2020, on may 4, 2020 we entered into a forbearance agreement with the lenders under the amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of march 28, 2018, by and among rosehill operating, as borrower, the company, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto, as lenders. pursuant to the forbearance agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, the lenders have agreed to forbear from exercising any rights or remedies arising from certain events of default under the amended and restated credit agreement. in addition, the scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base that was scheduled to occur on or about april 1, 2020, which we expected to result in a borrowing base deficiency, has been postponed throughout the forbearance period. the forbearance agreement will terminate on july 3, 2020. the forbearance agreement may be terminated earlier, if the company and certain stakeholders do not agree to a term sheet for a restructuring transaction within 25 days of the forbearance agreement, or if the company and those certain stakeholders do not enter into a restructuring support agreement within 40 days of the forbearance agreement. reaching agreement and entering into a restructuring support agreement requires consensus of multiple stakeholders. no assurances can be made that our stakeholders will be able to agree to a term sheet for a restructuring transaction or a restructuring support agreement as required under the forbearance agreement. even if our stakeholders enter into a restructuring support agreement, there can be no assurance that such restructuring will be consummated as contemplated or that we will realize the expected benefits thereof. any restructuring may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our common stock.if we are unable to agree to terms regarding a consensual restructuring prior to the termination of the forbearance agreement, we may be compelled to seek protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. so long as a proceeding related to a chapter 11 bankruptcy is ongoing, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization, which would pull resources away from our business operations. bankruptcy protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. in addition, the longer a proceeding related to a bankruptcy continues, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers would lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships or request financial assurances such as letters of credit and cash deposits. it is not possible to predict the outcome of any bankruptcy proceeding and in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, there can be no assurance that we would be able to restructure as a going concern or successfully propose or implement a plan of reorganization that provides for the continuation of the business post-bankruptcy.forward-looking statementsthis current report on form 8-k includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, including statements relating to the company’s ability to file its quarterly report, uncertainty about the spread of the covid-19 virus and the impact it may have on the company’s operations, the demand for the company’s oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and global economic activity in general. these forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from the company’s expectations, including our ability to continue as a going concern, our ability to prepare our quarterly financials and file our form 10-q within the expected timeframe, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the actions by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic, any further decline in, sustained

(the “company”), in consultation with management concluded that the previously issued unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six month period ended june 30, 2017 (the “interim financial statements”) contained in the company’s quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarterly period ended june 30, 2017, as filed with the securities and exchange commission (“sec”) on august 15, 2017, should no longer be relied upon. the company will restate the interim financial statements to reflect a non-cash dividend deemed to have been made to certain holders of its 8.000% series a cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock (the “series a preferred stock”) in connection with the business combination between the company (formerly known as klr energy acquisition corp.) and tema oil & gas company (the “business combination”). our independent registered public accounting firm, bdo usa, llp concurred with the audit committee’s conclusion. the interim financial statements do not reflect the beneficial value attributable to the nondetachable conversion option for the series a preferred stock as of april 27, 2017, the closing date of the business combination (the “closing date”). the company determined that a beneficial conversion feature existed as of the closing date and that as a result a non-cash dividend of $6.7 million should have been deemed made to certain holders of the series a preferred stock on the closing date. as a result, the net loss attributable to common shareholders of rosehill resources inc. for the three months ended june 30, 2017 is expected to increase and the net income attributable to common shareholders of rosehill resources inc. for the six months ended june 30, 2017 is expected to change to a net loss, in each case by $6.7 million from the amounts previously reported for the quarter ended june 30, 2017. basic and diluted earnings per share will decrease by $1.14 to a loss per common share of $1.22 for the three months ended june 30, 2017, and to a loss of $0.47 per common share for the six months ended june 30, 2017. the beneficial conversion feature will be recorded as a decrease to preferred stock and an increase to additional paid-in capital. because the preferred stock was convertible at issuance without a redemption date, the charge for the beneficial conversion feature is required to be taken immediately as a deemed dividend which will reduce the remaining amount of retained earnings and additional paid in capital for the six months ended june 30, 2017 and increase preferred stock. the ultimate effect of these adjustments was to record a deemed dividend which increased the loss available to common shareholders. this adjustment is a non-cash adjustment and has no impact on net cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities as reported in the interim financial statements. this adjustment also has no impact on adjusted ebitdax as reported in the company’s earnings announcement and other stockholder communications describing the company’s financial results for the second quarter of 2017. the company will restate the interim financial statements and file with the sec a form 10-q/a for the quarterly period ended june 30, 2017. the amended 10-q will include a discussion of the impact of the beneficial conversion feature on the company’s restated interim financial statements for the quarterly period ended june 30, 2017. management has concluded that the control deficiency that failed to detect the error constitutes a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting for the quarterly period ended june 30, 2017. management is currently evaluating and implementing remediation plans to address the material weakness in internal control. signature pursuant to the requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. rosehill resources inc. dated: november 2, 2017 by: /s/ r. craig owen	 name: r. craig owen title: chief financial officer (principal financial and accounting officer) ",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1659122/000161577417006164/0001615774-17-006164-index.htm,8-K,2017-11-02 17:19:41

(the “company”) and rosehill operating company, llc (the “buyer”), a subsidiary of the company, entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the “psa”) with whitehorse energy, llc (“whitehorse”), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, whitehorse energy delaware, llc (“whitehorse energy”) and whitehorse delaware operating, llc (“whitehorse operating” and together with whitehorse and whitehorse energy, the “whitehorse sellers”), siltstone resources ii - permian, llc (“siltstone ii”), and siltstone resources ii-b-permian, llc (“siltstone ii-b” and together with whitehorse sellers and siltstone ii, collectively, the “sellers”). pursuant to the psa, buyer agreed to acquire specified oil and gas wells, leases covering approximately 4,565 net acres and other associated assets and interests in the delaware basin (the “acquisition”). the consideration for the acquisition will be approximately $77.6 million in cash (the “purchase price”), subject to customary purchase price adjustments, including, among other things, adjustments for certain title defects and environmental defects asserted prior to november 24, 2017. subject to certain conditions under the psa, buyer shall acquire additional oil and gas leases located within a certain designated areas in the delaware basin (the “designated area”) from sellers for additional consideration calculated on the same basis as the purchase price, up to $80 million in cash in the aggregate. such additional oil and gas leases (subject to certain selection criteria set forth in the psa) include all oil and gas leases owned by any seller (or its affiliates) within the designated area as of the execution date but are not included in the initial 4,565 net acres being acquired and any oil and gas lease acquired by any seller (or its affiliates) during the period starting on the execution date and ending 90 days after the closing date (the “additional interests”). the closing of the acquisition, together with buyer’s acquisition of any additional interest sellers have title to as of november 15, 2017, is expected to occur on or about november 30, 2017 (the “target closing date”), with the effective date to be the same as the closing date, and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including the material accuracy of the representations and warranties of buyer and sellers and performance of covenants. buyer has the right to make a one-time election in writing no later than the target closing date to extend the target closing date to december 20, 2017 and buyer is required to make an extension payment in connection with such election. sellers have until 90 days after the closing date to notify buyer of any additional interests that were not previously submitted to buyer. upon such notification, buyer will have 30 days to conduct title and environmental due diligence. the conveyance of such additional interests will occur no later than 150 days after the closing date. in addition, buyer has a preferential purchase right under the psa to acquire any oil and gas lease owned by any seller (or its affiliates) within a certain geological area but outside of the designated area at a price calculated on the same basis as the purchase price. the psa contains other terms and conditions customary to transactions of this type. subject to the right of buyer to be indemnified for certain liabilities for a limited period of time and for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, buyer will assume substantially all post-effective time liabilities associated with the acquired properties. the psa may be terminated, subject to certain exceptions, (i) by mutual written consent of buyer and sellers, (ii) by either buyer or sellers if the closing of the acquisition has not occurred on or before december 31, 2017, (iii) by buyer or sellers in the event of certain material breaches of the psa by the other party that remain uncured for a period of thirty days after written notice of the breach, (iv) by buyer in the event the aggregate defect amount (as defined in the psa) exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the unadjusted purchase price in the aggregate and (v) by buyer if it has not been able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms as of the target closing date. the company is evaluating several potential sources of financing for the acquisition, including preferred equity, debt or a combination thereof. the company has no firm commitment for such financing and may not be able to obtain financing on desirable terms if at all. on october 24, 2017, buyer paid sellers a deposit of $6 million (the “deposit”) pursuant to the psa. if the psa is terminated under certain circumstances resulting from a breach of the psa by buyer or if buyer terminates the psa due to its inability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms by the target closing date, sellers will be entitled to retain the deposit as liquidated damages, which constitutes their sole and exclusive remedy for such termination. alternatively, if the psa is terminated under certain circumstances resulting from a breach of the psa by any seller, buyer will be entitled, in addition to legal and equitable remedies (including seeking damages from sellers or seeking specific performance of the psa), to receive a return of the deposit. the

combination agreement (the business combination agreement) dated as of december 20, 2016 by and between klre and tema oil and gas company (tema). subject to the terms of the business combination agreement and the adjustments set forth therein, we acquired a portion of the equity of rosehill operating company, llc (rosehill operating), a wholly-owned subsidiary of tema, to which tema contributed and transferred a portion of its assets and liabilities, for (i) the contribution to rosehill operating by us of $35.0 million in cash (the cash consideration) and for the issuance to rosehill operating by us of 29,807,692 shares of our newly created class b common stock (subject to certain adjustments as set out in the business combination agreement) (which cash and shares of class b common stock were immediately distributed by rosehill operating to tema), (ii) the assumption by rosehill operating of $55.0 million in tema indebtedness (the tema liabilities) and (iii) the contribution to rosehill operating by us of the remaining cash proceeds of our initial public offering (ipo). in connection with the closing of the business combination, (a) we issued to rosehill operating 4,000,000 warrants exercisable for shares of class a common stock (the tema warrants) in exchange for 4,000,000 warrants exercisable for rosehill operating common units (such class of warrants, the rosehill warrants) and (b) the tema warrants and the cash consideration were immediately distributed to tema. in addition, we contributed proceeds from the issuance of 75,000 shares of 8% series a preferred stock, common stock and 5,000,000 warrants of the company (the pipe investment) concurrent with the business combination to rosehill operating in exchange for rosehill

described in klres proxy statement dated april 12, 2017 (the proxy statement) relating to the special meeting of klres stockholders held on april 26, 2017 (the special meeting), which is incorporated by reference herein. in connection with the closing of the business combination (the closing), the company changed its name from klr energy acquisition corp. to rosehill resources inc. unless the context otherwise requires, when used in this current report on form 8-k,klre refers to the registrant prior to the closing, and we, us, our and the company refer to the registrant and its subsidiaries following the closing. item 1.01. entry into a material definitive agreement. tax receivable agreement on april 27, 2017, in connection with the closing, klre entered into that certain tax receivable agreement (the tax receivable agreement) with tema. the tax receivable agreement generally provides for the payment by the company to tema of 90% of the net cash savings, if any, in u.s. federal, state and local income tax that the company actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the closing as a result of: (i) any tax basis increases in the assets of rosehill operating resulting from the distribution to tema of the cash consideration, the shares of class b common stock and the warrants and the assumption of the tema liabilities in connection with the business combination, (ii) the tax basis increases in the assets of rosehill operating resulting from the redemption by rosehill operating or the exchange by the company, as applicable, of the membership interests in rosehill operating (the rosehill operating common units) for class a common stock or cash, as applicable, and (iii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by the company as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, payments it makes under the tax receivable agreement. the tax receivable agreement also provides that, until 36 months from the closing date (the protection period), for so long as tema beneficially holds at least 20% of the total issued and outstanding equity of rosehill operating (excluding temas beneficial ownership of rosehill operating through temas ownership of class a common stock of the company), the company shall not cause rosehill operating to sell, exchange or dispose of contributed assets (as defined in the business combination agreement) in any 12-month period during the protection period if, following such disposition, the cumulative aggregate amount realized (as that term is defined in section 1001 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended) from all dispositions of contributed assets during such 12-month period would be in excess of $40 million, without the consent of tema, which consent may be granted or withheld in temas sole discretion. the company shall provide notice to tema of any proposed disposition of contributed assets which would have an amount realized in excess of $20 million and the material terms of such disposition no later than 15 business days prior to the proposed disposition. due to the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of future 1 redemptions of rosehill operating common units by tema, it is uncertain as to when payments under the tax receivable agreement will commence. however, it is expected that payments will continue to be made under the tax receivable agreement for 15 years after the date of the last exchange of the rosehill operating common units by tema. the foregoing description of the tax receivable agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the tax receivable agreement, which is attached hereto as exhibit 10.1, and is incorporated herein by reference. amended and restated limited liability company agreement of rosehill operating at the closing, klre and tema entered into that certain first amended and restated limited liability company agreement of rosehill operating (the a&r llc agreement). following the closing, we will operate our business through rosehill operating and its subsidiaries. the operations of rosehill operating, and the rights and obligations of the holders of the rosehill operating common units, are set forth in the a&r llc agreement. appointment as managing member. under the a&r llc agreement, we are a member and the sole managing member of rosehill operating. as the sole managing member, we control all of the day-to-day business affairs and decision-making of rosehill operating without the approval of any other member, unless otherwise stated in the a&r llc agreement. as such, we, through our officers and directors, are responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of rosehill operating and the day-to-day management of rosehill operatings business. compensation. we are not entitled to compensation for our services as managing member. we are entitled to reimbursement by rosehill operating for any costs, fees or expenses incurred on behalf of rosehill operating (including costs of securities offerings not borne directly by members, board of directors compensation and meeting costs, cost of periodic reports to its stockholders, litigation costs and damages arising from litigation, accounting and legal costs); provided that we will not be reimbursed for any of our income tax obligations. distributions. the a&r llc agreement requires rosehill operating to make a corresponding cash distribution to the company at any time a dividend is to be paid by us to the holders of our series a preferred stock. the a&r llc agreement allows for distributions to be made by rosehill operating to its members on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of rosehill operating common units owned by each member out of funds legally available therefor. we expect rosehill operating may make distributions out of distributable cash periodically to the extent permitted by the debt agreements of rosehill operating and necessary to enable us to cover our operating expenses and other obligations, as well as to make dividend payments, if any, to the holders of our class a common stock. in addition, the a&r llc agreement generally requires rosehill operating to make pro rata distributions to its members, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to (i) pay our taxes and (ii) satisfy our obligations under the tax receivable agreement. rosehill operating common unit redemption right. the a&r llc agreement provides tema with a redemption right, which entitles tema to cause rosehill operating to redeem, from time to time, all or a portion of its rosehill operating common units (and a corresponding number of shares of class b common stock) for, at rosehill operatings option, newly-issued shares of our class a common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the average of the volume-weighted closing price of one share of class a common stock for the twenty trading days prior to the date tema delivers a notice of redemption for each rosehill operating common unit redeemed (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications). in the event of a reclassification event (as defined in the a&r llc agreement), the managing member is to ensure that each rosehill operating common unit (and a corresponding share of class b common stock) is redeemable for the same amount and type of property, securities or cash that a share of class a common stock becomes exchangeable for or converted into as a result of such reclassification event. upon the exercise of the redemption right, tema will surrender its rosehill operating common units (and a corresponding number of shares of class b common stock) to rosehill operating and (i) rosehill operating shall cancel such rosehill operating common units and issue to the company a number of rosehill operating common units equal to the number of surrendered rosehill operating common units and (ii) the company shall cancel the surrendered shares of class b common stock. the a&r llc agreement requires that we contribute cash or shares of our class a common stock to rosehill operating in exchange for the issuance to the company described in clause (i). rosehill operating will 2 then distribute such cash or shares of our class a common stock to tema to complete the redemption. upon the exercise of the redemption right, we may, at our option, effect a direct exchange of cash or our class a common stock for such rosehill operating common units in lieu of such a redemption. maintenance of one-to-one ratios. the a&r llc agreement includes provisions intended to ensure that we at all times maintain a one-to-one ratio between (a) (i) the number of outstanding shares of class a common stock and (ii) the number of rosehill operating common units owned by the company (subject to certain exceptions for certain rights to purchase equity securities of the company under a poison pill or similar shareholder rights plan, if any, certain convertible or exchangeable securities issued under the companys equity compensation plans and certain equity securities issued pursuant to the companys equity compensation plans (other than a stock option plan) that are restricted or have not vested thereunder) and (b) (i) the number of other outstanding equity securities of the company (including the series a preferred stock and the warrants) and (ii) the number of corresponding outstanding equity securities of rosehill operating. these provisions are intended to result in tema having a voting interest in the company that is identical to temas economic interest in rosehill operating. transfer restrictions. the a&r llc agreement generally does not permit transfers of rosehill operating common units by members, subject to limited exceptions. any transferee of rosehill operating common units must, among other things, assume by written agreement all of the obligations of a transferring member with respect to the transferred units. dissolution. the a&r llc agreement provides that rosehill operating shall dissolve upon the earlier of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of rosehill operating or upon the determination of the managing member. upon a dissolution event, the proceeds of a liquidation will be distributed in the following order: (i) first, to pay the expenses of winding up rosehill operating; (ii) second, to pay debts and liabilities owed to creditors of rosehill operating; and (iii) third, to set up cash reserves which the managing member reasonably deems necessary for contingent or unforeseen liabilities or certain future payments and (iv) fourth, (a) to the holders of series a preferred units pursuant to the terms of such securities and (b) then to the members pro-rata in accordance with their respective relative ownership of rosehill operating common units. indemnification and fiduciary duties. the a&r llc agreement provides for indemnification of the managing member, members and officers of rosehill operating and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates and provides that, except as otherwise provided therein, we, as the managing member of rosehill operating, have the same fiduciary duties to rosehill operating and its members as are owed to a corporation organized under delaware law and its stockholders by its directors. a copy of the a&r llc agreement is filed with this current report on form 8-k as exhibit 10.3

gateway will receive, gather, store, treat, and redeliver crude oil and gas production from receipt points within certain production areas located in loving county, texas that are exclusively

terms and conditions of the credit agreement, rosehill operating has a revolving line of credit and a letter of credit facility of up to $250 million, subject to a borrowing base that is determined semi-annually by the lenders based upon rosehill operatings financial statements and the estimated value of its oil and gas properties, in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans. rosehill operating and the lenders may each request an additional redetermination of the borrowing base once between two successive scheduled redeterminations. the borrowing base will be automatically reduced upon the issuance or incurrence of debt under senior unsecured notes or upon rosehill operatings or any of its subsidiarys disposition of properties or liquidation of hedges in excess of certain thresholds. amounts borrowed under the credit agreement may not exceed the borrowing base. rosehill operatings initial borrowing base is $55 million, which may be increased with the consent of all lenders. the senior secured revolving credit facility also does not permit rosehill operating to borrow funds if at the time of such borrowing, rosehill operating is not in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants. additionally, rosehill operatings borrowing base may be reduced in connection with the subsequent redetermination of the borrowing base. the amounts outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of rosehill operatings oil and natural gas properties and associated assets and all of the stock of rosehill operatings material operating subsidiaries that are guarantors of the senior secured revolving credit facility. if an event of default occurs under the senior secured

which include restrictions on the transfer of (i) 33% of their common stock through the first anniversary the closing date and (ii) 67% of their common stock through the second anniversary of the closing date, provided that sales of common stock above $18.00 per share (or, in connection with underwritten offerings by our sponsor and tema and subject to certain conditions, at a price reasonably expected to equal or exceed $18.00 per share and in any case equal to or in excess of $16.00 per share) will be permitted between the first and second anniversaries of the closing date. 19 warrants public stockholders warrants each of our warrants entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of our class a common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing 30 days after the completion of the business combination. the warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., new york city time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, unless an exemption is available. in the event that the conditions in the immediately preceding sentence is not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless, in which case, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of class a common stock underlying such unit. we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the closing of the business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the sec a registration statement for the registration, under the securities act, of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. we will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective no later than 90 days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within 90 days following the consummation of our initial business combination, public warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the securities act. in such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of class a common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the day prior to the date of exercise. if an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. once the warrants become exercisable, the company may call the warrants for redemption:  in whole and not in part;  at a price of $0.01 per warrant;  upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption (the 30-day redemption period) to each warrant holder; and  if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the class a common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; provided there is an effective registration statement with respect to the shares of class a common stock underlying such warrants and a current prospectus relating to those shares of class a common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. we have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. if the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. however, the price of the class a common stock may fall below the $21.00 redemption trigger price as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued. 20 if we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his, her or its warrant to do so on a cashless basis. in determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. if our management takes advantage of this option, all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the class a common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. if our management takes advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of class a common stock to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the fair market value in such case. requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. if we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option, our sponsor and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below. a holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such persons affiliates), to the warrant agents actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the shares of class a common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. if the number of outstanding shares of class a common stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of class a common stock, or by a split-up of shares of class a common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of shares of class a common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of class a common stock. a rights offering to holders of class a common stock entitling holders to purchase shares of class a common stock at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of class a common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of class a common stock actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for class a common stock) multiplied by (ii) one (1) minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of class a common stock paid in such rights offering divided by (y) the fair market value. for these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for class a common stock, in determining the price payable for class a common stock, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted average price of class a common stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of class a common stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights. in addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the holders of class a common stock on account of such shares of class a common stock (or other shares of our capital stock into which the warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of class a common stock in connection with the business combination or any initial business combination, (d) as a result of the repurchase of shares of class a common stock by the company if the business combination or any initial business combination is presented to the stockholders of the company for approval, or (e) in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete the business combination or any initial business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of class a common stock in respect of such event. 21 if the number of outstanding shares of our class a common stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of shares of class a common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of class a common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of class a common stock. whenever the number of shares of class a common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of shares of class a common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of shares of class a common stock so purchasable immediately thereafter. in case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of class a common stock (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such shares of class a common stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our outstanding shares of class a common stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the shares of our class a common stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. however, if such holders were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets for which each warrant will become exercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election, and if a tender, exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders (other than a tender, exchange or redemption offer made by the company in connection with redemption rights held by stockholders of the company as provided for in the companys charter or as a result of the repurchase of shares of class a common stock by the company if a proposed initial business combination is presented to the stockholders of the company for approval) under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the exchange act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of rule 12b-2 under the exchange act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of class a common stock, the holder of a warrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a stockholder if such warrant holder had exercised the warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the class a common stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustments (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the warrant agreement. additionally, if less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of class a common stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of class a common stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the per share consideration minus black-scholes warrant value (as defined in the warrant agreement) of the warrant. the warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. the warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of class a common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their 22 warrants and receive shares of class a common stock. after the issuance of shares of class a common stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of class a common stock. no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. if, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of class a common stock to be issued to the warrant holder. the public warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between continental stock transfer & trust company, as warrant agent, and us. the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. the information set forth in exhibit 4.1 to klres current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on march 16, 2016 is incorporated herein by reference. private placement warrants the private placement warrants (including the class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the business combination and they will not be redeemable by us and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees. our sponsor agreed to additional transfer restrictions relating to its common stock in connection with its entry into the shrra, which is described in the proxy statement in the section entitled proposal no. 1approval of the business combinationrelated agreementsshareholders and registration rights agreement. otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold as part of the units in our ipo. if the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the initial holders or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in our ipo. if holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they will pay the exercise price by surrendering his, her or its warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the class a common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. the reason that we agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our sponsor and permitted transferees is because it was not known at the time whether they will be affiliated with us following a business combination. if they remain affiliated with us, their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited. we have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time. even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities, an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information. accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the shares of class a common stock received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities. warrants issued in connection with business combination in connection with the closing, we issued 5,000,000 warrants to pipe investors and 4,000,000 warrants to tema. these warrants were issued on the same terms, and be subject to the same rights and obligations, as the public stockholder warrants. 23 financial statements and supplementary data the historical financial statements of rosehill operating for the three years ended december 31, 2016 are included in the proxy

changes in registrants certifying accountant. on april 27, 2017, the company completed the business combination, which was treated as a reverse acquisition for accounting purposes. as a result, the historical financial statements of rosehill operating, which were audited by bdo usa, llp (bdo), will become the historical financial statements of the company. (a) previous independent registered public accounting firm: on april 27, 2017, the board of directors of the company elected to dismiss marcum llp (marcum), which was the companys auditor prior to the business combination, as the companys independent registered public accounting firm effective upon the filing of the companys form 10-q for the three months ended march 31, 2017. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016, the period from september 21, 2015 (inception) through december 31, 2015, marcums audit report on the companys financial statements did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified as to audit scope or accounting principles, except that it contained an emphasis paragraph with respect to the uncertainty about the companys ability to continue as a going concern. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016, the period from september 21, 2015 (inception) through december 31, 2015 and the subsequent period through april 27, 2017, (i) there were no disagreements (as described in item 304(a)(1)(iv) of regulation s-k and the related instructions) between the company and marcum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to marcums satisfaction, would have caused marcum to make reference in connection with marcums opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement; and (ii) there were no reportable events as the term is described in item 304(a)(1)(v) of regulation s-k. we furnished a copy of this disclosure to marcum and have requested that marcum furnish us with a letter addressed to the sec stating whether such firm agrees with the above statements or, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. we have received the requested letter from marcum, and a copy of the letter is filed with this current report on form 8-k as exhibit 16.1. (b) new independent registered public accounting firm: on april 27, 2017, as part of the deemed change in independent registered public accounting firms described in section (a) above, the board confirmed, recommended and approved the appointment of bdo as the companys independent registered public accounting firm to audit the companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ending december 31, 2017. bdo previously served as the auditor for rosehill operating prior to the business combination and provided audit opinions in connection with rosehill operatings financial statements for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2015 and 2016. during the two most recent fiscal years and through april 27, 2017, the company has not consulted with bdo regarding (1) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event described in items 304(a)(1)(iv) or (v), respectively, or (2) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event described in items 304(a)(1)(iv) or (v), respectively, of regulation s-k. 25 item 9.01. financial statements and exhibits.

statements. as a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, klres actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these

business combination and transactions contemplated thereby; (iii) the inability to complete the business combination due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of klre, or other conditions to closing in the contribution agreement; (iv) the risk that the business combination disrupts current plans and operations of klre or tema as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions described herein; (v) klres ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of klre to grow and manage growth profitably following the business combination; (vi) costs related to the business combination; (vii) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (viii) the possibility that klre or tema may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors, including, but not limited to, future trends in energy markets and commodity prices; and (ix) other
