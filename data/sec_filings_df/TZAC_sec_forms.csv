involving tenzing and reviva pharmaceuticals, inc., a delaware corporation (“reviva”). the definitive proxy statement and other relevant documents will be mailed to shareholders of tenzing as of a record date to be established for voting on the business combination. shareholders of tenzing and other interested persons are advised to read, when available, the preliminary proxy statement, and amendments thereto, and the definitive proxy statement in connection with tenzing’s solicitation of proxies for the special meeting to be held to approve the business combination because these documents will contain important information about tenzing, reviva and the business combination, including the conversion (as defined below) which will result in tenzing re-domiciling from the british virgin islands to the state of delaware. shareholders will also be able to obtain copies of the registration statement and the proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, once available, on the sec’s website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to tenzing by contacting its chief executive officer, rahul nayar, c/o tenzing acquisition corp., 250 west 55th street, new york, new york 10019, at (212) 710-5220. participants in the solicitation tenzing and reviva and certain of their respective directors, executive officers, other members of management and employees, under sec rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the shareholders of tenzing in favor of the approval of the business combination. shareholders of tenzing and other interested persons may obtain more information regarding the names and interests in the proposed transaction of tenzing’s directors and officers in tenzing’s filings with the sec, including tenzing’s annual report on form 10-k for the year-ended february 29, 2020, which was filed with the sec on may 4, 2020. additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will also be included in the registration statement and other relevant documents when they are filed with the sec. free copies of these documents may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph. forward-looking statements certain statements made herein contain, and certain oral statements made by representatives of tenzing and reviva and their respective affiliates, from time to time may contain, “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. tenzing’s and reviva’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “might” and “continues,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, tenzing’s and reviva’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. most of these factors are outside of the control of tenzing or reviva and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement (as defined below); (2) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to the failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of tenzing or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (3) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of tenzing’s common stock on nasdaq following the business combination; (4) the risk that the business combination disrupts current plans and operations of reviva as a result of the announcement and consummation of the business combination; (5) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth economically and hire and retain key employees; (6) the risks that reviva’s products in development fail clinical trials or are not approved by the u.s. food and drug administration or other applicable authorities; (7) costs related to the business combination; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the possibility that tenzing or reviva may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (10) the impact of the global covid-19 pandemic on any of the foregoing risks and other risks and uncertainties to be identified in the proxy statement/prospectus (when available) relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and in other filings with the sec made by tenzing. the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. readers are referred to the most recent reports filed with the sec by tenzing. readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. tenzing and reviva undertake no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, subject to applicable law. 2 no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k and the exhibits hereto do not constitute a solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the business combination. this current report on form 8-k shall also not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any states or jurisdictions in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. no offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10 of the securities act of 1933, as amended,, or an exemption therefrom. item 1.01entry into a material definitive agreement. merger agreement this section describes the material provisions of the merger agreement (as defined below) but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. the following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit 2.1. tenzing’s shareholders, warrant holders and other interested parties are urged to read such agreement in its entirety. unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used below are defined in the merger agreement. general terms and effects on july 20, 2020, tenzing acquisition corp., a company incorporated in the british virgin islands (together with its successors, “tenzing”), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “merger agreement”) with tenzing merger subsidiary inc., a delaware corporation and newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of tenzing (“merger sub”), tenzing llc, a delaware limited liability company (“sponsor”), solely in the capacity as the representative from and after the effective time of the merger (as defined below) (the “effective time”) for the shareholders of tenzing (other than the reviva security holders (as defined below)) (the “purchaser representative”), reviva pharmaceuticals, inc., a delaware corporation (“reviva”), and laxminarayan bhat ph.d. (“dr. bhat”), solely in his capacity as the representative from and after the effective time for the reviva security holders (the “seller representative”). pursuant to the merger agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) prior to the closing (as defined below), tenzing will re-domicile from the british virgin islands to the state of delaware through a statutory re-domestication (the “conversion”), and (ii) upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the “closing”), merger sub will merge with and into reviva (the “merger” and, together with the conversion and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the “transactions”), with reviva continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of tenzing (after its re-domiciliation to delaware). in the merger, (i) all shares of reviva common stock and reviva preferred stock (together, “reviva stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than those properly exercising any applicable dissenters rights under delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration (as defined below); (ii) each issued and outstanding warrant to acquire shares of reviva common stock will be assumed by tenzing and automatically converted into a warrant for shares of tenzing common stock with its price and number of shares equitably adjusted based on the conversion of the shares of reviva common stock into the merger consideration (each, an “assumed warrant”); and (iii) each outstanding option to acquire reviva common stock (whether vested or unvested) will be assumed by tenzing and automatically converted into an option to acquire shares of tenzing common stock, with its price and number of shares equitably adjusted based on the conversion of the shares of reviva common stock into the merger consideration (each, an “assumed option”). at the closing, tenzing will change its name to “reviva pharmaceutical holdings, inc.”. 3 merger consideration the aggregate merger consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger agreement to holders of reviva stock as of immediately prior to the effective time (“reviva stockholders” and, together with the holders of reviva options and warrants immediately prior to the effective time, the “reviva security holders”) will be an amount equal to $62,400,000 (the “merger consideration”), plus the additional contingent right to receive the earnout shares (as defined below) after the closing, as described below. the merger consideration to be paid to reviva stockholders will be paid solely by the delivery of new shares of tenzing common stock, each valued at the price per share (the “redemption price”) at which each tenzing share of common stock is redeemed or converted pursuant to the redemption by tenzing of its public stockholders in connection with tenzing’s initial business combination, as required by its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and tenzing’s initial public offering prospectus (the “redemption”). the merger consideration will be allocated among holders of reviva’s common stock (“reviva common stockholders”) and the holders of reviva’s preferred stock (“reviva preferred stockholders”), such that reviva preferred stockholders will receive $11,000,000 in merger consideration (pro rata amongst them based on the number of shares of reviva preferred stock owned) before reviva common stockholders receive any merger consideration, and then the reviva common stockholders and reviva preferred stockholders will receive the remaining $51.4 million of the merger consideration pro rata treating the reviva preferred stock on an as-converted to common stock basis (which is currently on a one-for one basis); provided, however, that the merger consideration otherwise payable to reviva stockholders is subject to the withholding of the escrow shares (as defined below) and is subject to reduction for indemnification obligations. the merger consideration is not subject to any purchase price adjustments. certain convertible promissory notes of reviva will be required to convert into shares of reviva common stock prior to the closing, and will share in the merger consideration, as will certain obligations owed by reviva to a broker that will be paid with reviva common stock prior to the closing. however, the merger consideration does not include any value attributable to the assumed warrants or assumed options. escrow shares at the closing, ten percent (10%) of the merger consideration (the “escrow shares”) otherwise issuable to the reviva stockholders (allocated pro rata among the reviva stockholders based on the merger consideration otherwise issuable to them at the closing (“pro rata consideration”)) will be deposited into a segregated escrow account with continental stock transfer & trust company (or such other escrow agent reasonably acceptable to tenzing and reviva), as escrow agent, and held in escrow together with any dividends, distributions or other income on the escrow shares (the “escrow property”) in accordance with an escrow agreement to be entered into in connection with the transactions (the “escrow agreement”). the escrow property will be held in the escrow account for a period of twelve (12) months after the closing as the sole and exclusive source of payment for any post-closing indemnification claims (other than fraud claims and consent claims (as described below)). the reviva stockholders will have the right to vote the escrow shares while they are held in escrow. earnout in addition to the merger consideration set forth above, the reviva stockholders will also have a contingent right to receive up to an additional 1,000,000 shares of tenzing common stock (the “earnout shares”) after the closing based on the stock price performance of tenzing common stock and the achievement by reviva of certain clinical trial milestones during the three (3) year period following the closing (the “earnout period”). in order to receive the earnout shares, during the earnout period, both: ·the closing price of tenzing’s common stock has to be equal to or greater than $15.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period; and 4 ·reviva must receive positive data from (i) its first phase 3 trial in acute schizophrenia and (ii) either a phase 2 clinical trial in pulmonary arterial hypertension or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. if there is a final determination that the reviva stockholders are entitled to receive earnout shares, then such earnout shares will be allocated such that (i) one-half (1/2) of the earnout shares will be allocated to reviva preferred stockholders (pro rata amongst them based on the number of shares of reviva preferred stock owned) and (ii) the remaining one-half (1/2) of the earnout shares will allocated to all of the reviva stockholders pro rata, treating the reviva preferred stock on an as-converted to common stock basis (which is currently on a one-for-one basis). representations and warranties the merger agreement contains a number of representations and warranties by each of tenzing and reviva as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the date of the closing. many of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or material adverse effect. “material adverse effect” as used in the merger agreement means with respect to any specified person or entity, any fact, event, occurrence, change or effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of such person or entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of such person or entity or any of its subsidiaries on a timely basis to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the ancillary documents to which it is a party or bound or to perform its obligations thereunder, in each case subject to certain customary exceptions. certain of the representations are subject to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the merger agreement or in information provided pursuant to certain disclosure schedules to the merger agreement. the representations and warranties made by tenzing and reviva are customary for transactions similar to the transactions. indemnification and survival the representations and warranties of reviva survive the closing for twelve (12) months; provided, however, that fraud claims relating to reviva shall survive indefinitely. the representations and warranties made by tenzing do not survive the closing and tenzing does not have any post-closing indemnification obligations. reviva stockholders, severally and not jointly, will provide indemnification after the closing for any breach of any representations and warranties or covenants of reviva, with such indemnification based on the pro rata consideration received by each reviva stockholder. reviva stockholders will also provide indemnification after the closing for (a) any actions resulting from reviva’s failure to receive the approval of reviva stockholders, including those holding a majority of the reviva preferred stock, for the reviva charter amendment (as defined below) or the approval of the holders (“reviva noteholders”) of reviva’s issued and outstanding convertible promissory notes (the “convertible promissory notes”) for the convertible note amendment (as defined below) (any such indemnification claim, a “consent claim”), and (b) any actions by persons or entities who were (i) holders of equity securities of reviva or its subsidiary (including options, warrants, convertible debt or other convertible securities) prior to the closing arising out of the sale, purchase, termination, cancellation, expiration, redemption or conversion of any such securities or (ii) a director, officer, employee or consultant of reviva or its subsidiary arising out of or relating to the failure to grant promised equity securities of reviva (including options, warrants, convertible debt or other convertible securities) (excluding a specified known exception). indemnification claims by tenzing for breaches of reviva representations and warranties, other than certain fundamental representations, are subject to an aggregate deductible of $600,000, and there will be no indemnification for the first $600,000 of losses. indemnification claims can only be made against the escrow property, which is the sole source of remedy after the closing, except for fraud claims and consent claims. any escrow shares that are received by tenzing for indemnification claims will be cancelled by tenzing. the maximum aggregate amount of indemnification payments shall not exceed the amount of escrow property, except (i) in the case of fraud claims, it will not exceed the merger consideration actually paid (based on the redemption price) and (ii) in the case of consent claims, it will not exceed the amount of escrow property plus an additional $1 million (for which the reviva stockholders would need to come out-of-pocket). 5 covenants of the parties each party agreed in the merger agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the closing. the merger agreement also contains certain customary covenants by each of the parties during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the earlier of the closing or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms (the “interim period”), including (1) the provision of access to their properties, books and personnel; (2) the operation of their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business; (3) provision of financial statements by reviva; (4) tenzing’s public filings; (5) no insider trading; (6) notifications of certain breaches, consent requirements or other matters; (7) efforts to consummate the closing and obtain third party and regulatory approvals; (8) tax matters; (9) cfius compliance (if applicable); (10) further assurances; (11) public announcements; and (12) confidentiality. each party

transaction or any requests for non-public information relating to such transaction, and to keep the others informed of the status of any such inquiries, proposals, offers or requests for information. there are also certain customary post-closing covenants regarding (1) tax matters; (2) maintenance of books and records; (3) indemnification of directors and officers; and (4) use of trust account proceeds. the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby requires the approval of both tenzing’s shareholders and reviva’s stockholders. tenzing agreed, as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement, to prepare, with reasonable assistance from reviva, and file with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the “sec”), a registration statement on form s-4 (as amended, the “registration statement”) in connection with the registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the “securities act”) of the issuance of all or a portion (as agreed by reviva and tenzing in good faith) of the shares of tenzing common stock to be issued to the reviva stockholders, and containing a proxy statement/prospectus for the purpose of tenzing soliciting proxies from the shareholders of tenzing to approve the merger agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby and related matters (the “tenzing shareholder approval”) at a special meeting of tenzing’s shareholders (the “tenzing special meeting”) and providing such shareholders an opportunity to participate in the redemption. reviva also agreed in the merger agreement to call a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable after the registration statement has become effective and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from reviva stockholders proxies in favor of the merger agreement and the transactions and certain related matters (the “reviva stockholder approval”), and to take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure such approvals, including enforcing the voting agreement (as described below). the parties also agreed to take all necessary action, so that effective at the closing, the entire board of directors of tenzing (the “post-closing board”) will consist of five individuals, a majority of whom shall be independent directors in accordance with nasdaq requirements. two of the members of the post-closing board will be individuals (at least one of whom shall be an independent director) designated by tenzing prior to the closing and three of the members of the post-closing board (at least two of whom shall be independent directors) will be designated by reviva prior to the closing. at or prior to closing, tenzing will provide each of its director designees with a customary director indemnification agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such director. the parties also agreed to take all action necessary, so that the individuals serving as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, of tenzing immediately after closing will be the same individuals as that of reviva immediately prior to the closing. if during the interim period, tenzing, at its sole election, seeks to enter into and consummate subscription agreements with investors relating to a private equity investment in connection with the transactions (the “pipe investment”), reviva agreed to cooperate in connection with such pipe investment and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such pipe investment to occur, including having reviva’s senior management participate in any investor meetings and roadshows as reasonably requested by tenzing. reviva may, during the interim period, secure equity financing through the issuance of equity (and not debt or convertible debt) securities of reviva or tenzing, subject to the prior approval of tenzing. 6 reviva agreed to use its best efforts to, as promptly as practicable (but in any event within twenty (20) business days) after the

connection with the merger and the escrow agreement will be binding on all reviva stockholders, and (ii) file the reviva charter amendment with the secretary of state of the state of delaware; and (b)
