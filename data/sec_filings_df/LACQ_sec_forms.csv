february 11, 2020. lacq is furnishing an updated form of investor presentation that is attached as exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. lacq may use such presentation in meetings with certain of its stockholders, as well as other persons who might be interested in purchasing securities in connection with the proposed business combination. the information set forth in this item 7.01, including the exhibit attached hereto, is intended to be furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of section 18 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or the exchange act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. additional information in connection with the business combination, lacq has filed a preliminary proxy statement / prospectus and will file a definitive proxy statement / prospectus with the sec and will mail a definitive proxy statement / prospectus and other relevant documents to its stockholders. in addition, a registration statement on form f-4 was filed with the sec by the company that includes the preliminary proxy statement / prospectus and will be utilized for the registration of the securities to be issued in the business combination. investors and security holders of lacq are advised to read the preliminary proxy statement, the prospectus, amendments thereto, and, when available, the definitive proxy statement / prospectus in connection with lacqs solicitation of proxies for its stockholders meeting to be held to approve the business combination because the proxy statement / prospectus will contain important information about the business combination and the parties to it. the definitive proxy statement / prospectus will be mailed to stockholders of lacq as of a record date to be established for voting on the business combination. stockholders will also be able to obtain copies of the proxy statement / prospectus, without charge, once available, at the secs website at www.sec.gov or by directing a written request to leisure acquisition corp., 250 west 57th street, suite 2223, new york, new york 10017. some of the companys financial information and data contained herein and in the exhibit hereto does not conform to sec regulation s-x in that it includes certain financial information identified therein that is not derived in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs). accordingly, such information and data may be adjusted and presented differently in lacqs proxy statement to solicit stockholder approval of the proposed transaction. lacq and the company believe that the presentation of such non-ifrs measures are useful measures of performance and the company uses such measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons on a consistent basis from period to period, to provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. the financial projections in this report and the exhibit hereto are forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond lacqs and the companys control. while all projections are necessarily speculative, lacq and the company believe that the preparation of prospective financial information involves increasingly higher levels of uncertainty the further out the projection extends from the date of preparation. the assumptions and estimates
