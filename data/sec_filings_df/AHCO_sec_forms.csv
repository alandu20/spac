(“blocker seller”), in its capacity as blocker seller and as representative (as defined in the purchase agreement), entered into a stock purchase agreement and agreement and plan of merger (the “purchase agreement”) pursuant to which blocker seller agreed to sell to the company, and the company agreed to purchase from blocker seller, all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in lcp solara blocker corp., a delaware corporation (“blocker”), and merger sub agreed to be merged with and into solara, resulting in each of blocker and solara becoming subsidiaries of the company (the “acquisition”), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as further discussed below. the base purchase price for the acquisition is $425,000,000, consisting of a combination of cash, and 3,906,250 shares of class a common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“class a common stock”), of the company valued at $16 consisting of a combination of cash per share, payable at the closing, subject to customary adjustments to the cash portion of such payment for cash, indebtedness, transaction expenses and net working capital (as compared to an agreed target net working capital amount), and subject to approximately $10 million withheld in escrow to fund certain potential indemnification matters. the consummation of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of, among other customary closing conditions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties in the purchase agreement, the compliance by the parties with the covenants in the purchase agreement, the absence of any legal order barring the acquisition and the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino act. the parties are also provided with customary termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate the purchase agreement if the consummation of the acquisition has not occurred within 120 days after signing unless the failure of the acquisition to be consummated was substantially caused by such party; provided, however, solara and blocker seller may elect to extend this date for an additional 30 days. the acquisition is expected to close in june or july of 2020 subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions. under the purchase agreement, solara and blocker seller made representations and warranties with respect to the

such representations and warranties has occurred and by information in the accompanying disclosure schedules, which contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the

the following: ·during the period between the signing of the purchase agreement and the closing of the acquisition, solara shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to

on form 8-k includes certain statements that are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the united states private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, should, would, plan, predict, potential, seem, seek, future, outlook, and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding projections, estimates and forecasts of revenue and other financial and performance metrics and projections of market opportunity and expectations, 2 and the closing of the proposed transaction and the private placement. these statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of dfb and adapt management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of dfb and adapt. these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the outcome of judicial and administrative proceedings to which adapt may become a party or governmental investigations to which adapt may become subject that could interrupt or limit adapts operations, result in adverse judgments, settlements or fines and create negative publicity; changes in adapts clients preferences, prospects and the competitive conditions prevailing in the healthcare sector; the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the proposed transaction, including the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction or that the approval of the stockholders of dfb and/or the stockholders of adapt for the proposed transaction is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including as a result of a delay in consummating the proposed transaction or a delay or difficulty in integrating the businesses of dfb and adapt; the amount of redemption requests made by dfbs stockholders; those factors discussed in the preliminary proxy statement filed by dfb with respect to the proposed transaction under the heading risk factors, and other documents of dfb filed, or to be filed, with the sec. if the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither dfb nor adapt presently know or that dfb and adapt currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect dfbs and adapts expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this current report on form 8-k. dfb and adapt anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause dfbs and adapts assessments to change. however, while dfb and adapt may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, dfb and adapt specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing dfbs and adapts assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this current report on form 8-k. accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. item 8.01. other events. see item 7.01. item 9.01. financial statements and exhibits.

of 10,000,000, and rab ventures will purchase the remaining pipe shares. rab ventures is an entity that is controlled 2 by richard barasch, dfbs president, chief executive officer and chairman and is one of the members of deerfield/rab ventures, llc, dfbs sponsor (the sponsor). pursuant to the a&r subscription agreement, the pipe shares will be subject to a lock-up provision, pursuant to which they may not be sold or otherwise transferred for a period of time following the closing. the term of such lock-up period will be nine months for 7,500,000 pipe shares purchased by deerfield, and three months for any other pipe shares purchased in excess of that amount by either deerfield or rab ventures. deerfield (and rab ventures, if it purchases any pipe shares) will have registration rights with respect to the pipe shares pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement. except as described above, the terms of the a&r subscription agreement are substantially the same as the terms of the original subscription agreement, which are summarized in the july 8-k. no fees or other compensation was paid or will be payable to deerfield, rab ventures or any third parties in

letter agreement), which amends and restates in its entirety the letter agreement, dated july 8, 2019, among dfb, adapt and the sponsor (the original assignment agreement), pursuant to which the sponsor had agreed that it would, immediately prior to the closing, transfer and assign to adapt (or such other equityholders or employees of adapt as adapt may designate prior to the closing), 2,500,000 shares of common stock of dfb and 1,733,333 warrants to purchase shares of common stock of dfb (with each warrant exercisable for one-third of a share of dfb common stock). pursuant to the a&r assignment letter agreement, the sponsor will, immediately prior to the closing, transfer and assign to adapt (or such equityholders or employees of adapt as adapt may designate prior to the closing), for no consideration, between 2,437,500 and 2,500,000 of the shares of dfb common stock and between 1,690,000 and 1,733,333 of the warrants to purchase shares of dfb common stock held by the sponsor. the number of shares and warrants to be transferred will be determined based on the number of pipe shares purchased pursuant to the a&r subscription agreement. if the number of pipe shares purchased is 10,000,000 or less, then 2,500,000 shares and 1,733,333 warrants will be transferred. if the number of pipe shares purchased is 12,500,000, then 2,437,500 shares and 1,690,000 warrants will be transferred. if the number of pipe shares is more than 10,000,000 but less than 12,500,000, then the number of shares and warrants will be calculated on a pro rata basis, based on the number of pipe shares purchased in excess of 10,000,000. a portion of the shares to be transferred pursuant to the a&r assignment letter agreement may be transferred by dfbs executive officers and/or directors instead of the sponsor. the preceding summary of certain terms and conditions of the a&r assignment letter agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the a&r

management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from

judicial and administrative proceedings to which adapt may become a party or governmental investigations to which adapt may become subject that could interrupt or limit adapts operations, result in adverse judgments, settlements or fines and create negative publicity; changes in adapts clients preferences, prospects and the competitive conditions prevailing in the healthcare sector; the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the proposed transaction, including the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction or that the approval of the stockholders of dfb and/or the stockholders of adapt for the proposed transaction is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including as a result of a delay in consummating the proposed

assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither dfb nor adapt presently know or that dfb and adapt currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect dfbs and adapts expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this current report 4 on form 8-k. dfb and adapt anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause dfbs and adapts assessments to change. however, while dfb and adapt may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, dfb and adapt specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing dfbs and adapts assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this
