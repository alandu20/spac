explanatory note this amendment amends the current report on form 8-k of far point acquisition corporation (the company or far point), filed with the securities exchange commission (the sec) on january 16, 2020 (the original current report), in which far point reported, among other events, the execution of the merger agreement (as defined below). this amendment is being filed to attach the merger agreement and certain other agreements as exhibits to the current report on form 8-k, as amended, and to make certain related changes to the description of each such agreement. item 1.01 entry into a material definitive agreement. the merger agreement on january 16, 2020, far point entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the merger agreement), by and among the company, sl globetrotter, l.p., a cayman islands exempted limited partnership (globetrotter and, in its capacity as a representative of global blue (as defined below) and its shareholders as of the date of the merger agreement and immediately prior to the closing, the gb shareholders representative), global blue group holding ag, a stock corporation (aktiengesellschaft) incorporated under swiss law, with its registered office in 38, zürichstrasse, ch-8306 brüttisellen, switzerland (new global blue), global blue us holdco llc, a delaware limited liability company (us holdco), global blue us merger sub inc., a delaware corporation (us merger sub), global blue holding l.p., a cayman islands exempted limited partnership (cayman holdings), the individuals whose names appear on the signature pages thereof under the heading management sellers (the management sellers and, together with globetrotter and cayman holdings, the seller parties), global blue group ag, a stock corporation (aktiengesellschaft) incorporated under swiss law, with its registered office in 38, zürichstrasse, ch-8306 brüttisellen, switzerland (global blue), thomas w. farley, solely in his capacity as the fpac shareholders representative (fpac shareholders representative), solely for purposes of sections 2.20 and 8.01 thereof, far point llc, a delaware limited liability company (founder), and jacques stern, solely in his capacity as the management representative (management representative). pursuant to the merger agreement, the parties to the merger agreement have agreed that, in connection with the closing (as defined in the merger agreement), (i) the seller parties will undertake a series of transactions pursuant to which they will sell, exchange and contribute the ordinary shares of global blue for a mix of cash (cash consideration) and shares of new global blue (stock consideration) and (ii) a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of new global blue will merge with and into the company, with the company being the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of new global blue (the merger described in clause (ii), the merger, and together with the transactions described in clause (i), the business combination). pursuant to the merger each share of the companys common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing (other than excluded shares, as defined in the merger agreement) will be exchanged for one share of new global blues ordinary shares, and each company warrant will convert to a warrant to acquire one new global blue ordinary share on the same terms. upon consummation of the business combination, new global blue will be a publicly traded foreign private issuer. it intends to apply to list its shares and warrants on the new york stock exchange (the nyse) under the trading symbol gb. new global blue will be the ultimate parent company of the business currently operated by global blue and its subsidiaries. global blue is a leading provider of tax free shopping and payment solutions. the total consideration payable to the seller parties in connection with the business combination is based upon an enterprise value of global blue post-transaction of 2.3 billion (subject to adjustments based on indebtedness and other factors as more fully described in the merger agreement), a portion of which will be paid in cash consideration and the remainder of which will be paid in stock consideration. the cash consideration to be paid to the seller parties will be approximately $967mm, and will be funded by (i) the $646mm in company cash held in trust, (ii) $100mm equity capital committed by certain affiliates of third point llc, a delaware limited liability company (third point) (the third point pipe), (iii) $125mm equity capital committed by antfin (hong kong) ltd. (ant financial services group, a member of the alibaba digital economy) (ant financial), and (iv) $125mm equity capital committed by several established strategic equity investors (the investors in (ii), (iii) and (iv) collectively the pipe investors). the cash consideration amount is subject to adjustments as more fully described in the merger agreement, including a reduction in the event that payments are required to be made by the company in connection with the exercise by one or more of the companys stockholders of their redemption rights with respect to the companys shares of class a common stock (redemptions). the stock consideration to be issued to the seller parties will be in the form of common shares of new global blue; provided, that, in the event redemptions exceed 5,000,000, a portion of the stock consideration will be in the form convertible preferred shares of new global blue. the cash consideration and stock consideration are subject to customary post-closing adjustments as more fully described in the merger agreement. 1 in addition to the agreement with respect to the third point pipe, an affiliate of third point previously entered into an agreement at the time of the companys initial public offering to purchase shares of the companys common stock for $9.50 per share (the forward purchase shares) to the extent redemptions exceed 20,000,000 shares. in the event such third point affiliate is obligated to purchase any forward purchase shares as the result of such redemptions, third points pipe commitment will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as will the cash consideration (and there will be a corresponding increase in stock consideration). in addition to the founder share surrender agreement (as described below), the merger agreement provides that in connection with the business combination, the founder will contribute to new global blue 2,500,000 shares of class b common stock of the company (class b shares) held by the founder as of immediately prior to the closing, and that 2,500,000 shares of new global blue will be delivered to a nominee that will hold such shares for future delivery to the founder upon the achievement of certain future new global blue share trading levels. as a result of the business combination, assuming no redemptions, the existing company shareholders will hold approximately 39% of new global blue, the seller parties will hold approximately 42%, the pipe investors will hold approximately 19%. in addition, in connection with the business combination, global
