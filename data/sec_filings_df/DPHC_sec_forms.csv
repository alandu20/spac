merger sub will merge with and into lmc with lmc surviving the merger (the “merger”). upon consummation of the merger, lmc will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of lmc (“lmc common stock”) issued and outstanding at the effective time shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for the number of shares of class a common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the company (“company class a common stock”) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the purchase price (as defined in the merger agreement) by (b) $10.00 by (c) the fully diluted share number (as defined in the merger agreement) (such number of shares of company class a common stock, the “stock merger consideration”) (except for (i) holders of lmc common stock that are not accredited investors, who will receive an amount per share in cash equal to the stock merger consideration multiplied by $10.00 and (ii) holders of dissenting shares (as defined in the merger agreement), who shall, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such dissenting share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under section 2.14 of the merger agreement). additionally, each outstanding option to purchase shares of lmc common stock will be converted into an option to purchase shares of company class a common stock. in connection with the merger, subject to approval by the stockholders of the company and the other conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the company’s certificate of incorporation will be amended and restated to provide for, among other things, an increase in the authorized capital stock of the company. the closing of the merger is subject to certain conditions. each party’s obligation to consummate the merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, an absence of any governmental orders prohibiting the closing of the merger and approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by the company’s stockholders at a stockholders’ meeting duly called and held for such purpose or at any adjournment or postponement thereof taken in accordance with the merger agreement (the “special meeting”). the company’s obligation to consummate the merger is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by lmc in the merger agreement, (ii) no material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) having occurred since the execution of the merger agreement, (iii) certain contracts of lmc having been terminated, (iv) certain key employees remaining employed by lmc, (v) certain contracts of lmc remaining in place and (vi) the receipt of support agreements executed and delivered by lmc stockholders holding at least 95% of lmc

by the company in the merger agreement, (ii) the shares of parent class a common stock to be issued as the stock merger consideration having been approved for listing on the nasdaq and (iii) the company having cash on hand equal to or in excess of $300,000,000. the parties to the merger agreement have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement, including, among others, covenants with respect to the conduct of lmc, the company and merger sub prior to the closing of the merger. each of the company, lmc and merger sub has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the merger to be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable. notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the approval of the company’s stockholders at the special meeting, the company’s board of directors (the “board”) may fail to make, amend, change, withdraw, modify, withhold or qualify its recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement at the special meeting (a “change in recommendation”) if the board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that a failure to make a change in recommendation would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law. if the board makes a change in recommendation, it is no longer obligated to solicit proxies in favor of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. the merger agreement also includes limited indemnification obligations of the majority stockholder of lmc for breaches by lmc of certain fundamental representations and warranties, subject to certain limitations. 1 the merger agreement may be terminated by the company or lmc under certain circumstances, including, among others, (i) by mutual written consent of the company and lmc, (ii) if the closing of the merger has not occurred on or before february 1, 2021 (the “outside date”), subject to extension by mutual agreement of the parties, (iii) if the other party breaches its obligations under the merger agreement and such breach is not cured by the earlier of 30 days after written notice from the other party and the outside date, (iv) if the company has not obtained the required approval of its stockholders at the special meeting. lmc has the right to terminate their merger agreement prior to receipt of approval of the company’s stockholders if the company makes a changes in recommendation. the company also had the right to terminate the merger agreement if the lmc did not obtain written consents in support of the merger agreement from certain executive officers and large stockholders within 24 hours of the execution of the merger agreement. lmc delivered these required consents, which consents are sufficient to adopt the merger agreement under delaware law. the company also agreed to issue, upon the closing of the merger, (i) to holders of up to $40,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes to be issued by lmc, shares of company class a common stock at a conversion price of $10.00 per share and (ii) to brown gibbons lang & company (“bgl”), warrants to purchase shares of company
