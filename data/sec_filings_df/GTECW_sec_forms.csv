disease 2019 (covid-19), greenland technologies holding corporation (the “company”) is filing this current report on form 8-k to avail itself of an extension to file its annual report on form 10-k for the period ended december 31, 2019 (the “annual report”), which is originally due on march 30, 2020, relying on an order issued by the securities and exchange commission (the “sec”) on march 4, 2020 pursuant to section 36 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (release no. 34-88318) regarding exemptions granted to certain public companies. in december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china, which has and is continuing to spread throughout china and other parts of the world, including the united states. on january 30, 2020, the world health organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (covid-19) a “public health emergency of international concern,” and on march 11, 2020, the world health organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic.” due to the covid-19 outbreak, the company expects to delay the launch of its new product, a robotic cargo carrier with payload capacity of approximately 500 kilograms. moreover, the outbreak has significantly limited suppliers’ ability to provide low-cost, high-quality merchandise to the company on a timely basis. as a result, the company believes that its capability to produce transmission products has been significantly affected, and its business and results of operations have been materially and adversely affected. zhejiang province, where we conduct a substantial part of our business, is one of the most affected areas in china. the transportation restriction currently enforced in zhejiang province has caused difficulties for a third-party appraiser engaged by the company to complete the asset evaluation report of zhongchai holding (hong kong) limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. such evaluation report is necessary for the company’s auditor to complete its annual audit of the company. from late january 2020 until recently, the company’s employees were asked to work remotely. as a result, the company’s books and records were not easily accessible, resulting in delay in preparation and completion of its financial statements. based on the foregoing, the company expects to file the annual report on or around april 10, 2020 but no later than may 14, 2020. the company is supplementing the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 and its subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q with the following risk factor: war, terrorism, other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters such as a global pandemic may affect the markets in which the company operates, the company’s customers, the company’s delivery of products, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the company’s business may be adversely affected by instability, disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which it operates, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, and natural or manmade disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or pandemic events and spread of disease (including the recent outbreak of the new coronavirus commonly referred to as “covid-19”). such events may diminish suppliers’ ability to deliver low-cost, high-quality merchandise to the company on a timely basis, cause customers to suspend their decisions on ordering the company’s products, and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. these events also pose significant risks to the company’s personnel, physical facilities, and operations, which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial results. any significant disruption to communications and travel, including travel restrictions and other potential protective quarantine measures by governmental agencies, may increase the difficulty and could make it impossible for the company to deliver products to its customers. travel restrictions and protective measures could cause the company to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain the company’s ability to retain the highly skilled personnel the company needs for its operations. covid-19 has resulted in delayed product launch, reduced production capacity, and postponements and cancelations of orders from our customers. the extent to which covid-19 continues to impact the company’s business, sales, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 1 cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements this current report on form 8-k contains statements as to the company’s beliefs and expectations of the outcome of future events that are forward-looking statements. you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the anticipated impact of the covid-19 outbreak on travel, the anticipated impact of such outbreak on our results of operations, and possible effect of the postponement and cancellation of customer orders on our overall revenues. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the effects of the covid-19 outbreak, including on the demand for our products; the duration of the covid-19 outbreak and severity of such outbreak in regions where we operate; the pace of recovery following the covid-19 outbreak; our ability to implement cost containment and business recovery strategies; the adverse effects of the covid-19 outbreak on our business or the market price of our ordinary shares; and the risk and uncertainties described in the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 and our subsequent filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission, including subsequent periodic reports on forms 10-q and 8-k. except as required by law, the company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements made by it to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or the occurrence of unanticipated events. 2 signature pursuant to the

analysis. overview zhongchai holding, through its subsidiaries, is: ●a leading developer and manufacturer of traditional transmission products for material handling machineries in china; and ●a developer of a robotic cargo carrier prototype expected to be available for commercial use in the near future in china. zhongchai holding’s transmission products are key components for forklift trucks used in manufacturing and logistic applications, such as factories, workshops, warehouses, fulfillment centers, shipyards and seaports. forklifts play an important role in logistics systems of many enterprises across different industries in china and globally. generally, the industries with the largest demand for forklifts include the transportation, warehousing logistics, electrical machinery and automobile industries. zhongchai holding has experienced increased demand for forklifts in the manufacturing and logistics industries in the prc, as revenues increased from approximately $49.1 million in 2017 to approximately $60.2 million in 2018, albeit with declined revenue of approximately $40.5 million in the nine months ended september 30 compared with approximately $48 million in the same period of 2018, primarily due to reduction in production. based on revenue of the nine months ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, zhongchai holding believes that it is one of the major developers and manufacturers of transmission products for small and medium-sized forklift trucks in china. zhongchai holding’s transmission products are used in 1-ton to 15-ton forklift trucks, some with mechanical shift and some with automatic shift. zhongchai holding sells these transmission products directly to forklift truck manufacturers. in the nine months ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, zhongchai holding sold, in the aggregate, more than 61,891 and 73,503 sets of transmission products, respectively, to over 100 forklift manufacturers in china. 2 results of operations (a) for the

research-related equipment. r&d expenses decreased by approximately $0.35 million, or 18.1%, to approximately $1.6 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2019, as compared to approximately $1.95 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2018. the decrease of r&d expenses was primarily due to the company starting to settle into the new facility in june, caused the decreasing

working capital and other capital requirements primarily by equity contributions, cash flow from operations, short-term bank loans and bank acceptance notes, and long-term bank loans. cash is required primarily to purchase raw materials, repay debts and pay salaries, office expenses, income taxes and other operating expenses. zhongchai holding management believes that zhongchai holding has sufficient cash, together with expected profits and anticipated capital from existing funding sources, to operate for the next 12 months. zhongchai holding has generated, and is expected to continue to generate, positive cash flow from operations. zhongchai holding may need additional cash resources in the future if it experiences failure in collection of receivables, changed business conditions or other developments, and may also need additional cash resources in the future if it wishes to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation or other similar actions. if it is determined that the cash requirements exceed zhongchai holding’s cash and cash equivalents on hand, zhongchai holding may seek to issue debt or equity securities. zhongchai holding has expended considerable resources to build a new factory, resulting in lower levels of available cash during such periods. however, zhongchai holding management anticipates that cash flow will improve in the remaining months of 2019, given that the new factory construction has been completed. furthermore, management expects to pledge the new title deeds to banks in order to obtain additional loans and to refinance expiring loans next year, as well as to fund other working capital needs to the extent additional funds are available upon terms acceptable to zhongchai holding. see “note 16: related person transactions” above for a description of amounts payable to, and receivable from, related parties. there is no guarantee that the amounts payable by zhongchai equity holder will be repaid in whole or in part in the near future, if at all. any such failure could have a material negative impact on zhongchai holding’s balance sheet. 8 cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents refers to all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturity of three months or less. as of september 30, 2019, zhongchai holding had approximately $3.86 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of approximately $0.48 million, or 14.2%, as compared to approximately $3.38 million as of september 30, 2018. the increase of cash was mainly due to the increase in positive cash flows from operating and investing activities. restricted cash restricted cash represents amounts held by a bank as security for bank acceptance notes and therefore is not available for use until the bank acceptance notes have been fulfilled or expired, normally within a twelve-month period. as of september 30, 2019, zhongchai holding had approximately $2.13 million of restricted cash, a decrease of approximately $1.27 million, or 37.4%, as compared to approximately $3.40 million as of september 30, 2018. the decrease of restricted cash was due to maturity and settlement of bank acceptance notes that were subsequently released from escrow. accounts receivable as of september 30, 2019, zhongchai holding had approximately $11.79 million of accounts receivables, an increase of approximately $1.62 million or 15.9%, as compared to approximately $10.17 million as of september 30, 218. the increase in accounts receivable was due to the lower turnover on receivable. zhongchai holding recorded approximately $0.9 million of provision for doubtful accounts as of september 30, 2019. zhongchai holding conducted an aging analysis of each customer’s delinquent payments to determine whether allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, zhongchai holding considers historical experience, the economic environment, and the expected collectability of past due receivables. an estimate of doubtful accounts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. known bad debts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified. after zhongchai holding evaluated all the above considerations, zhongchai holding established a policy to provide a provision of 5% for accounts receivable aged within one year, provision of 20% for accounts receivable aged between one and two years, a provision of 50% for accounts receivable aged between two and three years, and a provision of 100% for accounts receivable aged over three years. zhongchai holding will continuously assess its potential losses based on the credit history and relationships with its customers on a regular basis to determine if its bad debt allowance on its accounts receivable is adequate. zhongchai holding believes that its collection policies are in line with the transmissions industry in china generally. notes receivable as of september 30, 2019, zhongchai holding had approximately $14.46 million of notes receivables. the decrease was approximately $1.88 million, or 11.5%, as compared to approximately $16.34 million as of september 30,

nine months ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, the main sources of cash inflow from operating activities were net income, change in inventories and other receivables, of approximately $3.25 million,$2.42 million and $3.95 million, respectively. the main causes of cash outflow were change in account receivable and note payable, of approximately $(2.18) million and $(3.85) million, respectively. in the nine months ended september 30, 2018, the main sources of cash inflow from operating activities were net income, change in note

approximately $(6.12) million and $(4.63) million, respectively. investing activities net cash provided in investing activities was approximately $1.67 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2019. cash provided in investing activities for the nine months ended september 30, 2019 was mainly due to the short-term investment in cash management products provided of approximately $2.19 million offset by approximately $ (0.41) million cash used for increase in construction-in-progress for the new factory. net cash provided in investing activities was approximately $(2.32) million for the nine months ended september 30, 2018. cash provided in investing activities for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 was mainly due to the short-term investment in cash management products provided of approximately $2.57 million offset by approximately $(3.52) million cash used for increase in construction-in-progress for the new factory. financing activities net cash used in financing activities was approximately $(6.67) million for the nine months ended september 30, 2019, mainly attributable to approximately $21.73 million proceeds from short-term bank loans, offset by repayments of short-term bank loans for approximately $(22.18) million, repayments of long-term bank loans for approximately $(4.74) million, approximately $(2.92) million repayment of loans from third parties, as well as approximately $(1.97) million repayment of loans from related parties. 10 net cash used in financing activities was approximately $(1.63) million for the nine months ended september 30,2018 mainly attributable to repayment of short-term and long-term bank loans of approximately $(8.87) million and $(0.38) million, repayment of loans from third parties of approximately $(3.06) million, respectively, mitigated by additional proceeds from short-term bank loans of approximately $11.93 million credit risk credit risk is one of the most significant risks for zhongchai holding’s business. accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenues earned from customers, thereby exposing zhongchai holding to credit risk. credit risk is controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. zhongchai holding identifies credit risk collectively based on industry, geography and customer type. this information is monitored regularly by management. in measuring the credit risk of sales to customers, zhongchai holding mainly reflects the “probability of default” by the customer on its contractual obligations and considers the current financial position of the customer and the exposures to the customer and its likely future development. liquidity risk zhongchai holding is also exposed to liquidity risk that it is unable to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and/or business needs. liquidity risk is managed by the application of financial position analysis to test if zhongchai holding is in danger of liquidity issues and also by application of monitoring procedures to constantly observing its conditions and movements. when necessary, zhongchai holding resorts to other financial institutions to obtain additional short-term funding to meet the liquidity shortage. inflation risk zhongchai holding is also exposed to inflation risk. inflationary factors, such as increases in raw material and overhead costs, could impair zhongchai holding’s operating results. although zhongchai holding does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on its ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of sales revenues if the selling prices of its products do not increase with such increased costs. off balance sheet arrangements none. 11 (a) financial statements of business acquired. in accordance

the registrant consummated the previously announced business combination (the “business combination”) following a special meeting of stockholders (the “special meeting”) where the stockholders of greenland acquisition corporation ( “greenland”, the “company”, “we” or “us” ) considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt an share exchange agreement (the “share exchange agreement”), dated as of july 12, 2019, entered into by and among (i) greenland, (ii) zhongchai holding (hong kong) limited, a hong kong company (“zhongchai holding”), (iii) greenland asset management corporation, a british virgin islands company with limited liability, in the capacity as the purchaser representative (the “purchaser representative”), and (iv) cenntro holding limited, the sole member of zhongchai holding (the “zhongchai equity holder” or the “seller”). pursuant to the share exchange agreement, greenland acquired from the seller all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of zhongchai holding in exchange for 7,500,000 newly issued ordinary shares, no par value of the company, to the seller (the “exchange shares”). as a result, the seller became the controlling shareholder of the company, and zhongchai holding became a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of the company (such transaction is referred as business combination herein below). the business combination was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by a share exchange, wherein zhongchai holding is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. prior to the business combination, we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in rule 12b-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended). as a result of the business combination, we have ceased to be a “shell company” and continued the existing business operations of zhongchai holding as a publicly traded company under the name “greenland technologies holding corporation.” as used in the report henceforward, unless otherwise stated or the context clearly indicates otherwise, the terms the “registrant,” “company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the consolidated company and its subsidiaries at and after the closing, giving effect to the business combination. item 2.01. completion of acquisition of disposition of assets. the share exchange and related transactions the

currently a party to any such claims or proceedings which, if decided adversely to the company, would either, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. indemnification of directors and officers our memorandum and articles of association (the “memorandum and articles of association”), as amended, the bvi business companies act, 2004, the insolvency act, 2003 of the british virgin islands, each of which as amended, and the common law of british virgin islands allow us to indemnify our officers and directors from certain liabilities. our articles provides that the company may indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate against all direct and indirect costs, fees and expenses of any type or nature whatsoever, any person who (a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, key employee, adviser of the company or who at the request of the company; or (b) is or was, at the request of the company, serving as a director of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another company. the company will only indemnify the individual in question if the relevant indemnitee acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. the decision of the board of directors of the company (the “board”) as to whether an indemnitee acted honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the company and as to whether such indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of our articles, unless a question of law is involved. the termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the relevant indemnitee did not act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the company or that such indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. the company may purchase and maintain insurance, purchase or furnish similar protection or make other arrangements including, but not limited to, providing a trust fund, letter of credit, or surety bond in relation to any indemnitee or who at the request of the company is or was serving as a director, officer or liquidator

“greenland”), with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (“sec”) on july 12, 2019, greenland entered into a share exchange agreement (the “share exchange agreement”) with zhongchai holding (hong kong) limited, a company incorporated under the laws of hong kong (“zhongchai holding”), greenland asset management corporation, a british virgin islands company with limited liability (the “sponsor”), in the capacity thereunder as the purchaser representative (the “purchaser representative”), and cenntro holding limited, the sole member of zhongchai holding (the “zhongchai equity holder”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, greenland will consummate the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of

26, 2019, the company filed with the sec a definitive proxy statement (the “definitive proxy statement”). as disclosed in the definitive proxy statement, on september 19, 2019, a purported class action challenging the business combination was filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware (the “district court”), captioned wheby v. greenland acquisition corporation, et al., case no. 19-1758-mn (d. del.) (the “action”). the action alleged certain violations of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and sought, among other things, to enjoin the business combination from closing (or, if consummated, to rescind the business combination or award rescissory damages), to require the company to issue a separate proxy statement, and to receive an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. the company believes that the allegations in the complaint are without merit and denies that any further disclosure beyond that already contained in the preliminary proxy statement is required under applicable law to supplement the preliminary proxy statement included therein which has been disseminated to shareholders of the company. nonetheless, in order to moot plaintiff’s unmeritorious disclosure claims, avoid nuisance and possible expenses, and provide additional information to the shareholders, the company determined to voluntarily make minor modifications to the definitive proxy statement, which the company deemed immaterial. on october 14, 2019, the plaintiff, the company and all other named defendants in the action entered into a confidential memorandum of understanding (the “mou”), pursuant to which a stipulation and order of dismissal (“stipulation of dismissal”) of the action was filed on october 14, 2019. the stipulation of dismissal was approved and entered by the district court on october 15, 2019. among other things, the stipulation of dismissal acknowledged that the definitive proxy statement mooted the plaintiff’s claims regarding the sufficiency of disclosures, dismissed all claims asserted in the action, with prejudice as to the plaintiff only, permits the plaintiff to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in connection with the mooted claims, and reserves the defendants’ rights to oppose such an award, if appropriate. on october 17, 2019, the company issued a press release announcing the entry of the mou and the district court’s approval of the stipulation of dismissal. a copy of the press release is attached hereto as exhibit 99.2. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits (d) exhibits. exhibit number exhibit 99.1 press release for adjournment of special meeting, dated october 17, 2019 99.2 press release for the dismissal of lawsuit, dated october 17, 2019 1 signatures pursuant to the requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. greenland acquisition corporation dated: october 18, 2019 by: /s/ yanming liu name: yanming liu title: chairman and chief executive officer 2 ",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1735041/000121390019020579/0001213900-19-020579-index.htm,8-K,2019-10-18 08:30:29
