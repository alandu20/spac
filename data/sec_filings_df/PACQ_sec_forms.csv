(“highpeak energy”) has applied to list its contingent value rights (the “contingent value rights”) on the nasdaq global market, however there is no certainty that the necessary approvals to list the contingent value rights will be obtained by the closing of the business combination (as defined below). on august 11, 2020, pure acquisition corp. (the “company”) announced that, in the event that highpeak energy’s contingent value rights are not approved for listing on an exchange by the closing of the business combination, the parties to the business combination agreement (as defined below) intend to waive the condition that the contingent value rights be approved for listing in connection with the closing of the business combination. under the business combination agreement, dated may 4, 2020 (as amended, the “business combination agreement” and the transactions contemplated thereby, the “business combination”), by and among the company, highpeak energy, pure acquisition merger sub, inc., a delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of highpeak energy (“mergersub”), highpeak energy, lp, a delaware limited partnership (“highpeak i”), highpeak energy ii, lp, a delaware limited partnership (“highpeak ii”), highpeak energy iii, lp, a delaware limited partnership (“highpeak iii”), hpk energy, llc, a delaware limited liability company (together with highpeak i, highpeak ii and highpeak iii, the “hpk contributors”), and solely for the limited purposes specified therein, highpeak energy management, llc, a delaware limited liability company (“hpk representative”), it is a condition to closing that the shares of highpeak energy common stock, warrants to purchase highpeak energy common stock, and contingent value rights (as each such security is defined in the business combination agreement) issuable as merger consideration in the business combination be approved for listing on either of the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq capital market at the closing of the business combination. highpeak energy is endeavoring to have the contingent value rights approved for listing (along with its other securities) on the nasdaq global market, but in the event that it is unable to do so at the time of the closing of the business combination, the company, highpeak energy and the hpk contributors have agreed to waive the condition requiring the contingent value rights to be approved for listing by such time. in the event that the contingent value rights are not approved for listing at the time of the closing of the business combination, highpeak energy intends to have the contingent value rights quoted over-the-counter (otc), while it works as expeditiously as possible to have them approved for listing on the national securities exchange in which highpeak energy’s common stock and warrants are listed. 1 legend information forward-looking statements the information included herein and in

thereunder. highpeak energy may not delay or suspend a registration statement on more than two (2) occasions for more than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days or more than ninety (90) total calendar

the purchasers under the a&r forward purchase agreement to elect to purchase forward purchase units (as defined in the form of a&r forward purchase agreement) thereunder, provided that the number of forward purchase units to be issued and sold thereunder does not exceed the maximum amounts specified therein, (d) permit the purchasers thereunder that are affiliates of the company’s sponsor to take certain actions without the consent of any unrelated third party purchasers and (e) expressly state that the purchasers under the a&r forward purchase agreement will have several and not joint
