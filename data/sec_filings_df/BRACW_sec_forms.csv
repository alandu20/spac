(“black ridge”), now known as allied esports entertainment, inc. (the “company”), and as updated pursuant to the supplement to the proxy statement filed with the commission on august 6, 2019 (the “proxy supplement”), black ridge entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization, dated as of december 19, 2018 (the “agreement”), with black ridge merger sub corp. (“merger sub”), allied esports media, inc. (f/k/a allied esports entertainment, inc.) (“aem”), noble link global limited (“noble”), ourgame international holdings ltd. (“ourgame”), and primo vital ltd. (“primo”). pursuant to the agreement, on the closing date, noble would merge with and into aem (the “redomestication merger”) with aem being the surviving entity of the redomestication merger, and immediately after the redomestication merger, merger sub would merge with and into aem (the “transaction merger” and together with the redomestication merger, the “mergers”), with aem being the surviving entity of the transaction merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. on august 5, 2019, the company entered into an amendment to the agreement (the “amendment”). the amendment reduced the closing condition originally contained in the agreement requiring black ridge to have minimum cash on hand following the proper exercise of conversion rights by the holders of public shares from at least $80,000,000 to $22,000,000 (the “cash closing condition”). the agreement also originally provided for the company to repay $35,000,000 of indebtedness of the entities which collectively comprise allied esports (“allied esports” or “aeii”) and the world poker tour® (hereinafter collectively referred to as “wpt”) owed to ourgame in cash at the closing of the transactions. pursuant to the amendment, the parties agreed that instead of paying the full $35,000,000 in cash at the closing, the company would (i) assume $10,000,000 of the debt obligations of ourgame and noble (including an additional $1,200,000 of accrued interest) and (ii) repay ourgame the remaining balance of $23,800,000 by (a) paying $3,500,000 in cash to ourgame and its designees, (b) issuing to ourgame and its designees 2,928,679 shares of the company’s common stock, and (c) ourgame retaining $1,000,000 of the proceeds of such loans to pay its transaction expenses incurred in the mergers (as defined below). black ridge oil & gas, inc., the company’s sponsor (the “sponsor”) also agreed to transfer an aggregate of 600,000 shares of the company’s common stock held by it to ourgame. additionally, on august 5, 2019, the company entered into an amendment and acknowledgement agreement (the “acknowledgement agreement”) pursuant to which allied esports and wpt amended the terms of a bridge financing, pursuant to which a series of convertible promissory notes (the “notes”) were previously issued, whereby bridge holders provided $14 million to be used for the operations of allied esports and wpt. pursuant to the acknowledgement agreement, the bridge holders have agreed to defer repayment of the notes to one year and two weeks following the closing of the mergers (the “closing,” and the maturity date of the notes, the “maturity date”). in consideration of agreeing to the deferred repayment, the bridge holders will be paid an additional six months of interest (i.e., a total of 18 months interest) to the extent any bridge holder elects not to convert their note to equity. the company agreed to assume the debt under the notes as part of the mergers, and agreed that the debt will be secured by all the assets of the company following the closing. the sponsor also agreed that following the closing, it would not make any further transfer of its initial shares, subject to certain exceptions, until the debt is repaid. the notes are convertible at any time by a holder between the closing and the maturity date, into shares that are freely tradable without restriction, at the lesser of $8.50 per share or the price at which shares are issued to ourgame or its affiliates in connection with the mergers. on august 9, 2019, black ridge held a special meeting of stockholders (the “special meeting”), at which the black ridge stockholders considered and adopted, among other matters, a proposal to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers. pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement, as amended by the amendment (collectively, the “merger agreement”), following the special meeting, on august 9, 2019 (the “closing date”), noble merged with and into aem with aem being the surviving entity of the redomestication merger, and immediately after the redomestication merger, merger sub merged with and into aem, with aem being the surviving entity of the transaction merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. as part of the closing, ourgame agreed to reduce the cash closing condition to $20.8 million. as a result of the mergers, the company is now the owner of allied esports and wpt. allied esports is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. wpt is the creator of the world poker tour – the premier name in internationally televised gaming and entertainment with brand presence in land-based tournaments, television, online and mobile. 2 item 2.01 of this current report on form 8-k (the “report”) discusses the consummation of the mergers and

initial public offering (“public shares”) exercised their rights to convert those shares to cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.29 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $126.2 million. 9,246,727 of such shares were redeemed in advance of black ridge’s special meeting held on july 9, 2019, and the remaining 3,015,124 were converted in advance of the special meeting. as a

(ii) five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,800,003 shares of common stock at a price per share of $11.50. additionally, the former owners of allied esports and wpt will be entitled to

exceeds $13.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and the like) for 30 consecutive trading days at any time during the five-year period after the consummation of the mergers. pursuant to the terms of the amendment, at the closing, the company also issued the following shares of its common stock: (i) 744,422 shares to management of wpt in satisfaction of profit participation agreements; (ii) 144,158 shares for prior bonus amounts owed to adam pliska, the president of the company post-closing and the ceo of wpt; (iii) 197,268 shares to finders (one of whom is adam pliska,

entered into subscription agreements with several third parties (the “subscribers”) pursuant to which the subscribers agreed to purchase an aggregate of $18,000,000 of shares of the company’s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. subscribers that were unable to purchase their full amount of shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions purchased 478,932 shares of common stock from the company at closing for $10.30 per share. one of the agreements also contains certain restrictions on the use of cash from the purchase following the closing of the mergers. at the closing, the company issued to the subscribers 262,136 shares of common stock pursuant to the agreements with the subscribers representing 1.5 shares of common stock for every 10 shares purchased by them under the purchase agreements. additionally, black ridge oil & gas, inc., the company’s sponsor from its initial public offering (the “sponsor”), transferred an aggregate of 720,000 shares held by it to the subscribers. after giving effect to the transactions, there are currently 23,088,700 shares of the company’s common stock issued and outstanding. upon the closing, the company’s common stock and warrants commenced trading on the nasdaq capital market under the symbols “aese” and “aesew,” subject to ongoing review of the company’s satisfaction of all listing criteria post-business combination. 3 as noted above, the aggregate conversion price of $126.2 million was paid to holders of public shares electing conversion from the company’s trust account, and the remaining balance immediately prior to the closing of approximately $15.9 million remained in the trust account. of the remaining amount in the trust account, (i) approximately $2.3 million was used to pay transaction expenses and (ii) the balance of approximately $13.6 million was released to the company to be used for working capital purposes. of the shares of the company’s common stock and warrants issued as consideration for the mergers, an aggregate of 1,160,275 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 380,000 shares of common stock (“escrow securities”) were placed in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement (“indemnity escrow agreement”) entered into by the company, continental stock transfer & trust company, as escrow agent, and a representative of the former owners of allied esports and wpt. the escrow securities provide a fund of payment to the company with respect to its post-closing rights to indemnification under the merger agreement for breaches of representations and warranties and covenants by the other parties to the agreement. claims for indemnification will be reimbursable to the full extent of the damages in excess of a $500,000 deductible (but in no event in excess of the securities held in escrow). the escrow securities shall be released from escrow, subject to reduction for shares cancelled for claims ultimately resolved and those still pending resolution at the time of the release, on august 9, 2020 (the one-year anniversary of the closing). form 10 information item 2.01(f) of form 8-k

$2.5 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $1.2 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the increase in multiplatform revenues all relate to the wpt business with increases in distribution revenue of approximately $551 thousand and approximately $545 thousand of music revenue. sponsorship and advertising revenue also increased by $241 thousand. interactive revenues increased by approximately $83 thousand, or 2%, to approximately $4.8 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $4.7 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the increase in interactive revenues all relates to the wpt business and pertains to an increase in product licensing revenue of approximately $83 thousand. other revenue increased approximately $22 thousand. wpt managed social gaming in-house in 2018, but has licensed out the product resulting in a $417 thousand decrease in the 2019 period as compared to the 2018 period. this is offset by an increase in 3rd party virtual products revenue of approximately $432 thousand. subscription revenue decreased by $37 thousand. in-person experiences revenues increased by approximately $2.4 million, or 63%, to approximately $6.3 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $3.9 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the increase in in-person revenues is driven by aeii, particularly revenue generated from aeii’s flagship esports arena las vegas, which opened its doors in march of 2018. aei’s revenues as a group increased by approximately $1.9 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. this was largely a result of increase in revenues at aeii’s flagship esports arena las vegas and gaming truck events. wpt casino revenue increased approximately $545 thousand for the six months ended june 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. costs and expenses multiplatform costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by approximately $1.1 million, or 101%, to approximately $2.1 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $1.1 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the increase in multiplatform costs was due to an increase of $872 thousand in production cost, an increase of $196 thousand in commissions. interactive costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by approximately $116 thousand, or 9%, to approximately $1.4 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $1.3 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the increase in interactive costs relates to increase in revenue share cost of $158 thousand in 2019 as compared to 2018. there was also an increase in platform fees of $59 thousand. there was an increase of $28 thousand in prize pool over the same period in 2018. this is offset by the lower processing fees of $97 thousand, fewer chargebacks of $25 thousand and reduced other costs of $7 thousand. in-person costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by approximately $1.3 million, or 46%, to approximately $1.5 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $2.8 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the decrease in in-person costs was due to the reduction in expenses related to the esports arenas santa ana and oakland which are not consolidated in the six months ended june 30, 2019 due to the reduction in ownership. therefore, no costs were included in these arenas for the six months ended june 30, 2019. online operating expenses decreased by approximately $1.2 million, or 70%, to approximately $0.5 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $1.8 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. wpt had a decrease in online expenses of approximately $891 thousand due to a decrease in development and hosting for the wpt platform. 6 selling and marketing expenses decreased by approximately $0.9 million, or 32%, to approximately $1.9 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $2.8 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the decrease in selling and marketing expenses is partially related to a decrease in aei’s advertising and promotion expense of approximately $524 thousand primarily pertaining to the grand opening of aei’s flagship arena in las vegas in early 2018, wpt had additional decreases in advertising costs of approximately $89 thousand for the clubwpt and playwpt products, $94 thousand decrease in agency and other promotional activities, and $210 thousand decrease in the costs incurred at events. general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.2 million, or 2%, to approximately $8.7 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $8.5 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the increase in general and administrative expenses related primarily to the wpt business increase in general and administrative costs of approximately $1.7 million largely due to a credit of $0.8 million in 2018 resulting from a change in incentive structures. wpt also incurred $518 thousand in audit and legal costs in preparation for the transaction. wpt also incurred $264 thousand of additional rent relating to the new lease. aeii’s general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.5 million due to a reduction in overall general corporate expenses that were related to grand opening of the flagship arena in las vegas as well as the exclusion of esports arenas santa ana and oakland expenses due to deconsolidation in the six months ended june 30, 2019. depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $0.1 million, or 2%, to approximately $3.4 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $3.3 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the increase in depreciation and amortization relates to increased depreciation for aeii’s flagship esports arena las vegas which was put into service in march of 2018 as well as the u. s. mobile arena truck which was purchased in january of 2018. the company started depreciating the assets related to aeii’s flagship esports arena las vegas in the second quarter of 2018. wpt depreciation and amortization decreased by $433 thousand for the six months ended june 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 mostly due to assets becoming fully depreciated and amortized, and assets that were previously fully depreciated being written off. impairment of investment in esa was approximately $0.6 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 and $4.3 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018. the losses were the result of the derecognition and disposal of the assets, liabilities and equity of an investment made in 2018 by aeii for which aeii conveyed a portion of its membership interests to the former non-controlling interest members in order to reduce its ongoing contribution requirements, thus reducing its membership interest to 25 percent. interest expense interest expense, was approximately $0.1 million and approximately $1.3 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the 2019 interest relates to $4.0 million of convertible debt incurred in april of 2019. all of the interest in the 2018 period was related to loans to aeii from its parent company and/or affiliates to fund operating and capital costs. the loans from its parent were converted to equity in november 2018. 7 year ended december 31, 2018 compared to years ended december 31, 2017

revenues multiplatform content revenues increased by approximately $1.6 million, or 108%, to approximately $3.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in multiplatform revenues all relates to the wpt business with increases in distribution revenue of approximately $0.7 million, sponsorship revenue of approximately $0.2 million, television sponsorship revenue of approximately $0.5 million and approximately $0.2 million of music revenue. interactive revenues increased by approximately $1.4 million, or 18%, to approximately $9.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $7.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in interactive revenues all relates to the wpt business and pertains to an increase in licensing revenue for virtual products. 8 in-person experience revenues increased by approximately $4.0 million, or 90%, to approximately $8.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $4.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in in-person revenues is driven by revenue from aeii, particularly revenue generated from aeii’s flagship esports arena las vegas, which opened its doors in march of 2018. aeii’s revenues increased approximately $4.2 million when comparing the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, of which approximately $2.8 million was generated by esports arena las vegas, approximately $0.9 million was from the two esports affiliates in santa ana and oakland prior to their deconsolidation on august 1, 2018, approximately $0.4 million was generated by the u. s. mobile arena truck purchased in january of 2018 and approximately $0.4 million from increased revenues for the european mobile arena truck. costs and expenses multiplatform costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by approximately $5.6 million, or 71%, to approximately $2.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $7.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the decrease in multiplatform costs was due to the write-off in 2017 of approximately $3.7 million of production costs as deferred production costs were in excess of forecast revenues. interactive costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by approximately $0.2 million, or 8%, to approximately $2.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $2.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the decrease in interactive costs largely relates to lower processing fees in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the mix of vendors. in-person costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by approximately $1.6 million, or 164%, to approximately $2.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $1.0 million in for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in in-person costs relates to increased activity due to the opening of the las vegas flagship arena in march of 2018. online operating expenses increased by approximately $0.5 million, or 29%, to approximately $2.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $1.7 for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in online expenses related to a increase in hosting fees for the wpt platform. selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately $0.6 million, or 19%, to approximately $4.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $3.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in selling and marketing expenses related to an increase in aeii’s advertising and promotion expense of approximately $1.0 million primarily pertaining to the grand opening of aeii’s flagship arena in las vegas, offset in part by a decrease in advertising costs of approximately $0.2 million for the clubwpt and playwpt products. general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.1 million, or 78%, to approximately $18.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $10.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in general and administrative expenses related primarily to increased general and administrative cost of approximately $9.8 million at aeii as it accelerated its activities with the opening of the esports arena las vegas and the u. s. mobile arena truck, and was comprised primarily of payroll and related costs, travel and professional services. offsetting the increase at aeii, the wpt business had decreased general and administrative costs of approximately $1.7 million largely due to a $1.2 million decrease in stock-based payments as a change in incentive structures and $0.4 million in decreased legal costs and other associated costs due to a 2017 restructuring of wpt. depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $2.5 million, or 60%, to approximately $6.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from approximately $4.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in depreciation and amortization relates to increased depreciation for aeii’s flagship arena in las vegas which was put into service in march of 2018 as well as the u. s. mobile arena truck which was purchased in january of 2018 9 impairment of investment in esa was approximately $9.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. there was no similar loss on deconsolidation in the 2017 comparative period. the 2018 loss was the result of the impairment, derecognition and disposal of the assets, liabilities and equity of an investment made earlier in 2018 by aeii for which aeii conveyed a portion of its membership interests to the former non-controlling interest members in order to reduce its ongoing contribution requirements, thus reducing its membership interest to 25 percent. impairment of deferred production costs and intangible assets was approximately $1.0 million in 2018. management determined that the projected cash flows from certain deferred production costs and intellectual property would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets. there was no comparable loss in 2017. interest expense, net interest expense, net, was approximately $2.1 million and approximately $0.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. of the interest expense, approximately $2.0 million in the 2018 period and all of the interest in the 2017 period was related to loans to aeii from its parent company and/or affiliates to fund operating and capital costs. the increase in interest expense is due to the increases in the note payable to parent balance as advances continued to be made throughout the last quarter of 2017 and the year ended december 31, 2018. the remaining interest expense in 2018 relates to a $5 million line of credit entered into by aeii in may of 2018 and repaid in october, 2018. net loss attributable to non-controlling interest net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was approximately $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. this is due to attributing the non-controlling share of losses to minority shareholders from january through july 31, 2018 while aeii was the majority shareholder in esa. there were no similar attributions of losses or net income in the 2017 comparative period. liquidity and capital resources aeii/wpt’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash on the balance sheet and borrowings from its parent. as of june 30, 2019, the company had cash, a working capital deficit and parent’s net investment of approximately $7.0 million, $33.6 million and $17.4 million, respectively. for the six months ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, the company incurred net losses of approximately $6.7 million and $17.6 million, respectively, and used cash in operations of $5.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively. the aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of these condensed combined financial statements. on may 15, 2019, noble issued a series of secured convertible promissory notes (the “notes”) whereby investors provided noble with $4 million to be used for the operations of aeii/wpt. the notes accrue annual interest at 12%; provided that no interest is payable in the event the notes are converted into company common stock as described below. the notes are due and payable on the first to occur of (i) the one-year anniversary of the issuance date, or (ii) the date on which a demand for payment is made during the time period beginning on the closing date of the merger and the date that is three (3) months after the closing date of the merger upon conversion of the notes into equity as part of the merger. if the note is paid by aem or brac, the investor will receive one year of interest. as security for purchasing the notes, the investors received a security interest in allied esports’ assets (second to any liens held by the landlord of the las vegas arena for property located in that arena), as well as a pledge of the equity of all of the entities comprising wpt, and a guaranty of ourgame and the company. the debt is convertible into shares of brac common stock at $8.50 per share. additionally, on august 5, 2019, the company entered into an amendment and acknowledgement agreement (the “acknowledgement agreement”) pursuant to which allied esports and wpt amended the terms of a bridge financing, pursuant to which the notes and another $10 million series of convertible promissory notes (collectively, the “bridge notes”) were previously issued, whereby bridge holders provided $14 million to be used for the operations of allied esports and wpt. pursuant to the acknowledgement agreement, the bridge holders have agreed to defer repayment of the bridge notes to one year and two weeks following the closing of the mergers (the “closing,” and the maturity date of the notes, the “maturity date”). in consideration of agreeing to the deferred repayment, the bridge holders will be paid an additional six months of interest (i.e., a total of 18 months interest) to the extent any bridge holder elects not to convert their bridge note to equity. the company agreed to assume the debt under the bridge notes as part of the mergers, and agreed that the debt will be secured by all the assets of the company following the closing. the sponsor has also agreed that it will not make any further transfer of its initial shares, subject to certain exceptions, until the debt is repaid. the bridge notes are convertible at any time by a holder between the closing and the maturity date, into shares that are freely tradable without restriction, at the lesser of $8.50 per share or the price at which shares are issued to ourgame or its affiliates in connection with the mergers. 10 each bridge note holder will receive a warrant to purchase shares of brac common stock in an amount equal to the product of (i) 3,800,000 shares, multiplied by (ii) the investor’s investment amount, divided by (iii) $100,000,000. the warrants will be subject to the exercise price and such other terms and conditions as determined by brac and ourgame in the merger; provided, however, the terms and conditions of the warrant and the date of issuance of the warrants shall be the same as the warrants to be issued to ourgame, the company and/or its affiliates in connection with the merger. if the investors in the bridge financing elect to convert their bridge notes into company common stock, they would be entitled to receive additional shares of company common stock (the “earn-out shares”) equal to the product of (i) 3,846,153 shares, multiplied by (ii) the investor’s investment amount, divided by (iii) $100,000,000, if at any time within five years after the closing date of the merger, the last exchange-reported sale price of company common stock trades at or above $13.00 for thirty (30) consecutive calendar days. cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities the tables below summarize cash flows for the six months ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, and the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. six months ended june 30, year ended december 31, in thousands 2019 2018 2018 2017 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $(4,965) $(9,989) $(14,612) $(10,759) investing activities (2,219) (20,252) (23,072) (6,133) financing activities 3,683 30,531 34,295 27,974 net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities primarily represents the results of operations exclusive of non-cash expenses, including depreciation, amortization, losses on disposal of assets, stock-based compensation and the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities. net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended june 30, 2019 was approximately $5.0 million as compared to approximately $10.0 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018, a decrease of approximately $5.0 million. the primary driver for the decrease in cash used in operating activities was a decrease in the net loss to approximately $6.7 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019 from approximately $17.6 million in the comparable 2018 period. the reduction in loss was driven by increased sales, primarily from increased in-person revenues generated from aeii’s flagship esports arena las vegas as well as an increase in truck revenue and events revenue and a reduction in impairment expenses of approximately 3.7 million. changes in operating working capital items (excluding cash, debt and balances due to parent) increased cash used in operations by $2.4 million and $1.2 million for the six months ended june 30, 2019, and 2018 respectively. net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was approximately $14.6 million as compared to approximately $10.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $3.8 million. the primary driver for the increase in cash used in operating activities was the increase in general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses which together represent approximately $8.7 million increase and result primarily from the growth of the operations of aeii, which was formed in 2016 and experienced an increase in activity with the construction and completion of its las vegas arena in 2018. net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to the purchase of property and equipment. 11 net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended june 30, 2019 was approximately $2.2 million as compared to approximately $20.3 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018, a decrease of approximately $18.0 million. the primary driver for the decrease in cash used in investing activities was the construction and completion of aeii’s las vegas arena in 2018. net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was approximately $23.1 million as compared to approximately $6.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $17.0 million. the primary driver for the increase in cash used in investing activities was the construction and completion of aeii’s las vegas arena in 2018. net cash provided by (used in) financing activities net cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to the proceeds from cash infusions from ourgame in the form of notes or intercompany payables and the issuance of allied esports’ line of credit and the issuance of convertible notes in 2019. net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended june 30, 2019 was approximately $3.7 million as compared to approximately $30.5 million for the six months ended june 30, 2018, a net decrease of approximately $26.8 million. the primary driver for the decrease was a net decrease in cash infusions from ourgame for the six months ended june 30, 2019 of $30.8 million as compared the comparable 2018 period offset by $4.0 million of convertible debt obtained in 2019. the cash infusions in the six months ended june 30, 2018 were primarily used for the construction and completion of aeii’s las vegas arena. net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was approximately $34.3 million as compared to approximately $28.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $6.3 million. the primary driver for the increase was cash infusions of approximately $34.3 million from ourgame in the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to approximately $28.0 million in the comparable 2017 period. proceeds of approximately $5.0 million from the issuance of an allied esports’ line of credit were received in 2018 and subsequently repaid in the same year. capital expenditures aeii will require continual investment to facilitate its growth plans. as a result of the reduced cash available after the closing of the merger, we plan to pivot our business goals to focus on expanding and strengthening our strategic partnerships and developing other potential avenues of business, which we are in the process of finalizing. we will provide further updates in future filings as we update our business plans. debt agreements line of credit in may 2018, allied esports entered into a $5,000,000 line of credit with a bank, bearing interest of 2.650% per annum with monthly payments of interest only. the line of credit is secured by a $5,000,000 certificate of deposit provided by parent as collateral. all outstanding principal and accrued interest were due at maturity in may 2019. during the year ended december 31, 2018, allied esports paid an aggregate $55,178 of interest payments. in october 2018, the $5,000,000 line of credit was repaid by the parent using its collateralized certificate of deposit resulting in an addition to the balances due to the parent. 12 convertible debt see “related part transactions – second bridge financing” below. contractual obligations aeii/wpt enters into certain contractual obligations in the normal course of its business. the following table summarizes the known contractual commitments as of june 30, 2019: (in thousands) total less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years more than 5 years operating lease obligations 27,923 2,229 4,979 5,029 15,686 total $27,923 $2,229 $4,979 $5,029 $15,686 off-balance sheet arrangements aeii/wpt does not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities, nor does aeii/wpt have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities. customer concentration one customer accounted for 11% and 15% of aeii/wpt revenues for the six months ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. during the six months ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, 11% and 15%, respectively, of aeii/wpt revenue was from customers in foreign countries. during the year ended december 31, 2018, one customer accounted for 15% of total aeii/wpt revenue. no customer accounted for more than 10% of the aeii/wpt revenue in the year ended december 31, 2017. during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, 14% and 17%, of aeii/wpt revenue was from customers in foreign countries. seasonality historically, wpt’s results of operations have not been significantly affected by seasonality. aeii’s results of operations maybe affected by seasonality in the las vegas market where 1st and 4th quarters tend to be slightly lower than the rest of the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aeii/wpt is exposed to market risks from foreign currency fluctuation. aeii/wpt has not entered into any derivative financial instrument transaction to manage or reduce market risk for speculative purposes. aeii/wpt has no significant exposure to interest rate or commodity price fluctuation. the combined financial statements are subject to subject to concentrations of credit risk consisting primarily of accounts receivable. 13 critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. aeii/wpt regularly evaluates estimates and judgments based on historical experience and other relevant facts and circumstances. aeii/wpt discusses its significant estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements in the notes accompanying the financial statements. listed below are the accounting policies aeii/wpt believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved. impairment of long-lived assets the company reviews for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. the evaluation of asset impairment requires the company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. during the year ended december 31, 2018 the company recorded an aggregate of $1,005,292 for impairment charges related to deferred production costs and intangible assets, and recorded an impairment charge of $9,683,158 related to its investment in esa. during the six months ended june 30, 2019 the company recorded an impairment charge of $600,000 related to its investment in esa. deferred production costs capitalized production costs represent the costs incurred to develop and produce the company’s proprietary shows. these costs primarily consist of labor, equipment, production overhead costs and travel expenses. capitalized production costs are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization and tax credits, if applicable, or fair value. production costs in an amount up to the amount of ultimate revenue expected to be earned from the related production are capitalized in accordance with fasb asc topic 926-20-50-2 “other assets – film costs” and are amortized over the expected revenue period using a ratio of revenue earned during the period to estimated ultimate revenues for the related production. costs incurred in excess of expected ultimate revenue are expensed as incurred and included in multiplatform costs in the accompanying combined statements of operations. unamortized capitalized production costs are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period on a season-by-season basis. if estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized capitalized production costs for that season, the unamortized capitalized production costs will be written down to fair value. due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of revenues and expenses, these estimates are likely to differ to some extent from actual results. the company’s management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs, participations and residuals and/or write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized deferred production costs to its estimated fair value. revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) fees are fixed or determinable, and (4) the collectability is reasonably assured. for multiple element contracts, the company allocates consideration to the multiple elements based on the relative selling price of each separate element which are determined using vendor specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or the company’s best estimate in order to assign relative fair values. 14 recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update (“asu”) no. 2014-09, “revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606),” (“asu 2014-09”). asu 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605 - revenue recognition (“asc 605”) and most industry-specific guidance throughout asc 605. the fasb has issued numerous updates that provide clarification on a number of specific issues as well as requiring additional disclosures. the core principle of asc 606 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asc 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing u.s. gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. the guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. the guidance may be adopted through either retrospective application to all periods presented in the financial statements (full retrospective approach) or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the effective date (modified retrospective approach). the guidance was revised in july 2015 to be effective for private companies and emerging growth public companies for annual and interim periods beginning on or after december 15, 2018. except for certain contracts related to the company’s distribution and event revenue streams, the company has completed its asc 606 analysis and, to date, no material differences in revenue recognition policies have been identified, as compared to asc 605. in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, “leases (topic 842)” (“asu 2016-02”). asu 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases. asu 2016-02 will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. asu 2016-02 is effective for private companies and emerging growth public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. the company is currently evaluating asu 2016-02

transition requirements as asu 2016-02. upon the effective date, asu 2018-10 will supersede the current lease guidance in asc topic 840, leases. under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis.

2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-11, “leases (topic 842): targeted improvements,” (“asu 2018-11”). the amendments in asu 2018-11 related to transition relief on comparative reporting at adoption affect all entities with lease contracts that choose the additional transition method and separating components of a contract affect only lessors whose lease contracts qualify for the practical expedient. the amendments in asu 2018-11 are effective for private companies and emerging growth public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, and interim periods within those

weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. all other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. the amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an

authorized to issue 65,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001. as of the date of this report, 23,088,700 shares of common stock are outstanding. no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. the following description summarizes the material terms of our securities. because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. for a complete description you should refer to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the form of warrant agreement, which are filed as exhibits to this report, and to the applicable provisions of delaware law. common stock our stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. there is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares eligible to vote for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. our stockholders have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the shares of common stock. 21 preferred stock there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. no shares of preferred stock are being issued or registered in this offering. accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. we may issue some or all of the preferred stock to effect a business combination. in addition, the preferred stock could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us. although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. warrants each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time after september 9, 2019 until expiration. however, no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless we have an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by section 3(a)(9) of the securities act, provided that such exemption is available. if that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. in such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value”(defined below) by (y) the fair market value. the “fair market value” for this purpose will mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of common stock for the 5 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of exercise. the warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., new york city time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. we may call the warrants for redemption (excluding certain warrants), in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant. · at any time after the warrants become exercisable, · upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder, · if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders; and · if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. the right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. on and after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder’s warrant upon surrender of such warrant. the redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants. 22 if we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” in such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. the “fair market value” shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of common stock for the 5 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. the warrants are in registered form under a warrant agreement between continental stock transfer & trust company, as warrant agent, and us. the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval, by written consent or vote, of the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants (including the private warrants) in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. the exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. however, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below their respective exercise prices. the warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price, by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. the warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of shares of common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of common stock. after the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to have declared effective a prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and keep such prospectus current until the expiration of the warrants. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so and, if we do not maintain a current prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their warrants for cash and we will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the warrant exercise. warrant holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their warrants such that an electing warrant holder would not be able to exercise their warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, such holder would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% of the shares of common stock outstanding. no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. if, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be

agent for our securities and rights agent for our rights and warrant agent for our warrants is continental stock transfer & trust company, 1 state street plaza, new york, new york 10004. recent sales of unregistered securities reference is made to the disclosure set forth under item 3.02 of this report concerning the issuance of the company’s common stock and warrants in connection with the transactions, which is incorporated herein by reference. indemnification of directors and officers the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions eliminating the personal liability of directors to the company and its stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors to the fullest extent permitted by section 145 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware or any other applicable law as it exists on the date of the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or as it may be amended. the general corporation law of the state of delaware prohibits such elimination of personal liability of a director for: · any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders; · acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; · the payment of dividends, stock repurchases or redemptions that are unlawful under delaware law; and · any transaction in which the director receives an improper personal benefit. these provisions only apply to breaches of duty by directors as directors and not in any other corporate capacity, such as officers. in addition, these provisions limit liability only for breaches of fiduciary duties under the general corporation law of the state of delaware and not for violations of other laws such as the u.s. federal securities laws and u.s. federal and state environmental laws. as a result of these provisions in the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the company’s stockholders may be unable to recover monetary damages against directors for actions taken by them that constitute negligence or gross negligence or that are in violation of their fiduciary duties. however, the company’s stockholders may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief for these actions. these provisions also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors that might benefit the company. in addition, the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the company will indemnify and advance expenses to, and hold harmless, each of the company’s directors and officers (each, an “indemnitee”), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he, or a person for whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the company or, while a director or officer of the company, is or was serving at the company’s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee. notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the company will be required under the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws to indemnify, or advance expenses to, an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such indemnitee only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the indemnitee was authorized by the company’s board of directors. 24

(the “company”) entered into an amendment (the “amendment”) to the previously announced agreement and plan of merger, dated as of december 19, 2018 (the “agreement”), by and among the company, black ridge merger sub corp. (“merger sub”), allied esports media, inc. (f/k/a allied esports entertainment, inc.) (“aem”), noble link global limited (“noble”), ourgame international holdings ltd. (“ourgame”), and primo vital ltd. (“primo”). the amendment reduces the closing condition originally contained in the agreement requiring the company to have minimum cash on hand following the proper exercise of conversion rights by the holders of public shares from at least $80,000,000 to $22,000,000. the agreement also originally provided for the company to repay $35,000,000 of indebtedness of allied esports and the world poker tour owed to ourgame in cash at the closing of the transactions (the “closing”). pursuant to the amendment, the parties agreed that instead of paying the full $35,000,000 in cash at the closing, the company would (i) assume $10,000,000 of the debt obligations of ourgame and noble (including an additional $1,200,000 of accrued interest) and (ii) repay ourgame the remaining balance of $23,800,000by paying $3,500,000 in cash to ourgame and its designees, issuing to ourgame and its designees 2,928,679 shares of the company’s common stock and ourgame retaining $1,000,000 of the proceeds of such loans to pay its transaction expenses incurred in the merger. in connection with entering into the amendment, black ridge oil & gas, inc., the company’s sponsor (the “sponsor”), agreed to transfer an aggregate of 600,000 shares of the company’s common stock held by it to ourgame. in connection with the execution of the amendment, the parties entered into an amendment and acknowledgment agreement (“acknowledgment agreement”) whereby the terms of the previously issued convertible notes (“notes”) of allied esports and wpt (collectively “aeii/wpt”) whereby bridge holders provided $14 million to be used for the operations of aeii/wpt were amended. pursuant to the acknowledgement agreement, the bridge holders have agreed to defer repayment of the notes to one year and two weeks following the closing (the “maturity date”). in consideration of agreeing to the deferred repayment, the bridge holders will be paid an additional six months of interest (i.e., a total of 18 months interest) to the extent any bridge holder elects not to convert their note to equity. the company has agreed to assume the debt under the notes as part of the mergers contemplated by the agreement, and agreed that the debt will be secured by all the assets of the company following the closing. the sponsor has also agreed that it will not make any further transfer of its securities of the company, subject to certain exceptions, until the debt is repaid. the notes are convertible at any time by a holder between the closing and the maturity date at the “conversion price.” the “conversion price” is the lesser of $8.50 per share or the price at which shares are issued to ourgame or its affiliates in connection with the mergers. on august 5, 2019, the company and the sponsor also entered into several additional share purchase agreements with several third parties. the form of the purchase agreements was the same form of purchase agreement that was previously executed by the company on july 17, 2019 with lyle berman, a director of the company and the sponsor and morris goldfarb, a stockholder of the sponsor, as previously reported on by the company in a current report on form 8-k filed on july 19, 2019. all of such purchase agreements are hereafter collectively referred to as the “purchase agreements” and all of the purchasers are hereafter referred to collectively as the “purchasers.” pursuant to the purchase agreements, the purchasers have agreed to purchase an aggregate of $18,000,000 of shares of the company’s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. if the purchasers are unable to purchase the full $18,000,000 of shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions, the company will issue to the purchasers newly issued shares at the closing at a per-share price equal to the per-share amount held in the company’s trust account (currently approximately $10.30 per share), and having an aggregate value equal to the difference between $18,000,000 and the dollar amount of shares purchased by them in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. one of the agreements also contains certain restrictions on the use of cash from the purchase. at the closing, the company has agreed to issue to the purchasers 1.5 shares of common stock for every 10 shares purchased by them under the purchase agreements. additionally, the sponsor has agreed to transfer an aggregate of 720,000 shares held by it to the purchasers. pursuant to the purchase agreements, the company is required to file a registration statement with the sec as promptly as practicable following closing to register the resale of any securities purchased by the purchasers that are not already registered and cause such registration statement to become
