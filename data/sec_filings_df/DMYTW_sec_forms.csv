llc, a delaware limited liability company, in its capacity as the sellers representative (in such capacity, the sellers representative). the transactions contemplated by the business combination are referred to herein as the business combination. business combination agreement consideration and structure pursuant to the business combination agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, at the time of the closing of the business combination (the closing), (i) (x) the company or a wholly-owned subsidiary thereof will contribute cash to rsi (the contribution amount) in exchange for common units of rsi (the rsi units and such rsi units issued to the company, the issued rsi units) and the number of shares of newly issued class v common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the company (the class v voting stock) equal to the number of retained rsi units (as defined below), which will entitle its holder to one vote per share but no right to dividends or distributions and (y) immediately thereafter, rsi will distribute to the sellers the shares of class v voting stock received by rsi, (ii) the sellers will transfer to the company or a wholly-owned subsidiary thereof a number of rsi units (not to exceed 12,500,000 rsi units) equal to the quotient of (a) the purchased rsi units cash consideration (as defined below) divided by (b) $10 (the purchased rsi units), and certain rights under the tax receivable agreement (as defined and discussed below), and (iii) the sellers will following the closing retain an aggregate number of rsi units equal to the number of rsi units (such rsi units retained by the sellers, the retained rsi units) that will cause the sellers aggregate percentage ownership in rsi immediately following the closing to be equal to the percentage determined as the quotient of (a) rsis enterprise value (i.e., $1,725,000,000) (subject to certain post-closing adjustments discussed below) (the rsi enterprise value) divided by (b) the sum of (1) the rsi enterprise value plus (2) the product of (a) the total number of outstanding shares of class a common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the company (the class a common stock) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing (after giving effect to any redemptions of class a common stock by the companys current stockholders, the class b common stock conversion (as defined and discussed below), and any class a common stock purchased in connection with any equity financing transactions completed at or prior to the closing, if any) multiplied by (b) $10. in connection with the closing, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of company, dated as of february 20, 2020 (the current certificate of incorporation), and the amended insider letter (as defined below), all then-outstanding shares of class b common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the company (the class b common stock) will be converted into shares of class a common stock (after giving effect to the amended sponsor letter (as defined below)) on a one-for-one basis and into an aggregate number of 5,750,000 shares of class a common stock (the class b common stock conversion). in connection with the closing, on the date of the closing (the closing date), (i) 1,212,813 shares of class a common stock held by the sponsor and the independent directors of the company (collectively, the founder holders) that formerly constituted shares of class b common stock held by the founder holders, (ii) 1,212,813 issued rsi units issued to the company in connection with the business combination, and (iii) 15,000,000 retained rsi units held by the sellers and an equal number of shares of class v voting stock issued to the sellers by the company in connection with the business combination, will be subject to certain restrictions and potential forfeiture pending the achievement (if any) of certain earnout targets pursuant to the terms of the business combination agreement. following the closing, the combined company will be organized in an up-c structure in which substantially all of the assets and the business of the combined company will be held by rsi and its subsidiaries, and the companys only direct assets will consist of rsi units and all of the limited liability company units of a delaware limited liability company that will be formed at or prior to closing for purposes of acting as the general partner of rsi (such entity, the gp company). assuming that (i) none of the companys current stockholders exercise their right to redeem their class a common stock, (ii) the aggregate proceeds received by the company through equity financing sources at, or prior to, the closing is $160,000,000, and (iii) the sellers transfer to the company the maximum number of purchased rsi units (i.e. 12,500,000), the company is expected to own, directly or indirectly, approximately 22% of rsi units in rsi and will control rsi through the gp company, which will be appointed as the general partner of rsi in accordance with the terms of the rsi a&r lpa (as defined and discussed below) and all remaining rsi units will be owned by the sellers. under certain circumstances, depending on redemptions by the companys current stockholders, the company may, directly or indirectly, own approximately 12% of the rsi units following the closing. pursuant to the business combination agreement, the rsi enterprise value is subject to adjustment following the closing in the event that the transaction expenses attributable to rsi and the sellers, on the one hand, or the company and the sponsor, on the other hand, exceed the transaction expense cap with respect to the applicable party (such adjustments more fully described in the business combination agreement). pursuant to the business combination agreement, the contribution amount will be equal to the sum of (i) the cash remaining in the companys trust account as of immediately prior to the closing following any redemptions of class a common stock by the companys current stockholders and payment of the aggregate amount of transaction expenses incurred by the parties to the business combination agreement as of the closing plus (ii) the aggregate amount of proceeds received by the company at or prior to the closing pursuant to the subscription agreements (as defined below) (such amount, as adjusted, the available closing date cash). to the extent that available closing date cash exceeds $160,000,000, an amount of the available closing date cash (not to exceed $125,000,000) determined by calculating the sum of (i) the available closing date cash less one hundred $160,000,000 (provided that the amount of cash attributable to this clause (i) is subject to a cap of $60,000,000) plus (ii) 50% of the amount by which available closing date cash exceeds $220,000,000 (provided that the amount of cash attributable to this clause (ii) is subject to a cap of $65,000,000) (such amount, the purchased rsi units cash consideration) will be used to purchase from the sellers the purchased rsi units and the remainder of available closing date cash will be contributed to rsi in exchange for issued rsi units. additionally, in the event the company receives additional proceeds through equity financing sources during the five day period following the closing date, (x) the company will cause such amounts to be contributed to rsi (the post-closing contribution amount), and in exchange rsi will issue the company or its wholly-owned subsidiary additional rsi units, in an amount equal to the number of shares of class a common stock sold by the company to such equity financing sources, at the price at which the shares of class a common stock were sold by the company to such equity financing sources, and (y) thereafter, so long as the sellers have not already sold to the company 12,500,000 rsi units, rsi will redeem a corresponding number of retained rsi units from the sellers in exchange for either (a) all of the post-closing contribution amount (in the event the amount of the available closing date cash and the post-closing contribution amount, in the aggregate, exceeds $160,000,000 but is less than $220,000,000) or (b) 50% of the post-closing contribution amount (up to $65,000,000) (in the event the amount of the available closing date cash and the post-closing contribution amount, in the aggregate, exceeds $220,000,000), and the sellers will forfeit a corresponding number of class v voting stock held by the sellers. the purchased rsi units cash consideration and the post-closing contribution amount (payable to the sellers) will not in the aggregate exceed $125,000,000. beginning on the six month anniversary of the closing, each retained rsi unit held by the sellers may be exchanged, subject to certain conditions, for either one share of class a common stock or, at the election of the gp company in its capacity as the general partner of rsi, the cash equivalent of the market value of one share of class a common stock, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the rsi a&r lpa (such exchange rights, as further described in the rsi a&r lpa, the exchange rights). for each retained rsi unit so exchanged, one share of the class v voting stock will be canceled by the company. upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement, the company will change its name to rush street interactive, inc. representations, warranties and covenants the parties to the business combination agreement have agreed to customary representations and warranties for

statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. the companys and rsis actual results may differ from their expectations,

combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside the companys and rsis control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement, (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the company and rsi following the announcement of the business combination agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the proposed transaction, including due to failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of the company, certain regulatory approvals or satisfy other conditions to closing in the business combination agreement; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement or could otherwise cause the transaction to fail to close; (5) the impact of covid-19 on rsis business and/or the ability of the parties to complete the business combination; (6) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the shares of common stock of the post-acquisition company on the new york stock exchange following the business combination; (7) the risk that the business combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the business combination; (8) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (9) costs related to the business combination; (10) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (11) the possibility that rsi or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement relating to the business combination, including those under risk factors therein, and in the companys other filings with the sec. the company cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. the company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements
