(“fnf”) and f&g (the “tax opinion closing condition”) and (ii) to waive the tax opinion closing condition. the terms of the merger agreement among the parties provide that the waiver of the tax opinion closing condition is within the sole control of the special committee. as previously announced, the anticipated closing date for the transaction is june 1, 2020, assuming that f&g shareholders approve the merger and related proposals at the f&g extraordinary general meeting scheduled to be held virtually on may 29, 2020, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions at the closing. there is no anticipated impact on the closing of the transaction stemming from this waiver. as previously disclosed in the registration statement (file no. 333-237540) of fnf on form s-4 filed on april 1, 2020 with the u.s. securities and exchange commission and the related definitive proxy statement of f&g in connection with the f&g extraordinary general meeting, if the total consideration to be paid to f&g ordinary shareholders exercising dissenters’ rights is significant, f&g might not be able to obtain the tax opinion, and f&g might waive the tax opinion closing condition and allow the completion of the mergers to proceed without a tax opinion. the waiver of the tax opinion closing condition does not mean that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement between fnf and f&g will not qualify as a “reorganization” for u.s. federal income tax purposes, but given the number of dissenting shares, it is possible that such transactions may not qualify as a “reorganization” for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if the transactions were not to qualify as a “ reorganization” for u.s. federal income tax purposes, f&g shareholders would generally be treated as selling their f&g ordinary shares in a taxable sale for u.s. federal income tax purposes. f&g shareholders are urged to read the section in the registration statement (file no. 333-237540) of fnf on form s-4 filed on april 1, 2020 with the u.s. securities and exchange commission, and the related definitive proxy statement of f&g in connection with the f&g extraordinary general meeting, each as amended and supplemented through the date hereof, entitled “the mergers—material u.s. federal income tax consequences of the mergers” and to consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax implications to them of the special committee’s waiver of the tax opinion closing condition. cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements “safe harbor” statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995: this current report on form 8-k contains, and certain oral statements made by our representatives from time to time may contain, forward-looking statements relating to f&g and fnf, including statements relating to the proposed transaction and related matters. such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of f&g and fnf, that could cause actual results, events and developments to differ materially from those set forth in, or implied by, such statements. these statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the management of f&g and fnf, respectively. forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of the words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “might,” or “continues” or similar expressions. factors that could cause actual results, events and developments to differ include, without limitation: (1) changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against f&g or fnf following the announcement of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of f&g or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or could otherwise cause the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to fail to close; (5) the risk that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement disrupt current plans and operations of f&g or fnf as a result of the announcement thereof; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the management of f&g and fnf to grow and manage their respective businesses profitably and to retain their key employees; (7) costs related to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the risk that the mergers may not be treated as a single integrated transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” under section 368(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, in which case the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be treated as a taxable sale by u.s. holders of their f&g shares in exchange for the merger consideration; (10) adverse legal and regulatory developments or determinations or adverse changes in, or interpretations of, u.s. or other foreign laws, rules or regulations, including tax laws, rules and regulations, that could delay or prevent completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, cause the terms of such transactions to be modified or change the anticipated tax consequences of such transactions;

grant date of such company phantom unit and the date on which the first effective time occurs. at the first effective time, each vested company phantom unit and each unvested company phantom unit will

product (with the result rounded to the nearest two decimal places) of (i) the number of company ordinary shares subject to each company phantom unit immediately prior to the first effective time multiplied by (ii) the exchange ratio. immediately following the first effective time, each parent phantom unit will continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (after giving effect to the changes described above) as were applicable to the corresponding company phantom unit immediately prior to the first effective time; provided that any unvested parent phantom units will be subject to the accelerated vesting upon an involuntary termination of the holder’s service relationship within two (2) years following the closing date. subject to the terms and conditions of the merger

(the issuer) issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2025 (the notes). the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of the closing date (the base indenture), among the issuer, the guarantors from time to time party thereto (the guarantors) and wells fargo bank, national association, as trustee (the trustee), and a supplemental indenture thereto (the supplemental indenture and, together with the base indenture, the indenture). the issuer will pay interest on the notes in cash on may 1 and november 1 of each year at a rate of 5.50% per annum. interest on the notes will accrue from and including the closing date and the first interest payment date will be november 1, 2018. the notes will mature on may 1, 2025. as further described below under items 1.02 and 8.01, the proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used by the issuer to (i) repay $135 million principal amount outstanding under the issuers revolving credit facility and to pay accrued interest and expenses in connection therewith and (ii) redeem in full and satisfy and discharge all of the outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of the issuers 6.375% senior notes due 2021. the remainder of such proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include additional capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the issuers direct parent, fgl us holdings inc., a delaware corporation, the issuers indirect parent, cf bermuda holdings limited, a bermuda exempted limited liability company (the parent), and certain existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries of the parent, other than its insurance subsidiaries. under certain circumstances, the indenture permits the parent to designate certain of its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, which subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants in the indenture and will not guarantee the notes. the notes are the general unsecured senior obligations of the issuer and each guarantee is the general unsecured senior obligation of each guarantor (the guarantee). the notes and the related guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of the issuers and the guarantors future secured debt, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. the notes and the guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to all of the issuers and the guarantors future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes and the guarantees and equal in right of payment with any of the issuers and the guarantors other senior indebtedness. in addition, the notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all of the liabilities of existing and future subsidiaries of the parent that do not guarantee the notes. at any time prior to february 1, 2025, the issuer may, at its option, redeem the notes in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. thereafter, the issuer may, at its option, redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time at the issuers option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. in the event of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indenture), each holder of the notes will have the right to require the issuer to repurchase all or any part of such holders notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. if the issuer sells assets outside the ordinary course of business and does not use the net proceeds for specified purposes, it may be required to use such net proceeds to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. the indenture contains covenants that restrict the parents and its restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of equity interests or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create liens on certain assets to secure debt, sell certain assets, consummate certain mergers or consolidations or sell all or substantially all assets, or enter into transactions with affiliates. the indenture also provides for customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest or premium, failure to comply with covenants, and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. the foregoing summary of the base indenture and supplemental indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the base indenture and supplemental indenture, copies of which are incorporated by reference in this current report on form 8-k as exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. item 1.02. termination of a material definitive agreement on april 16, 2018, the issuer instructed wells fargo bank, national association, as trustee (the 2021 notes trustee) of its 6.375% senior notes due 2021 (the 2021 notes) to deliver a notice of redemption to the holders of the outstanding 2021 notes. on april 20, 2018, the issuer caused approximately $307.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes to be irrevocably deposited with the 2021 notes trustee to satisfy and discharge the indenture governing the 2021 notes, dated march 27, 2013, as amended and restated on november 20, 2017, among the issuer, the guarantors from time to time party thereto and the 2021 notes trustee. the deposited funds are to be held in trust until may 16, 2018 (the redemption date), at which time such money will be used to fund the redemption of the outstanding 2021 notes (including the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding 2021 notes to, but excluding, the redemption date) at a redemption price of 101.594% of the aggregate principal amount thereof. item 8.01. other events on april 24, 2018, the issuer repaid $135 million principal amount outstanding under the issuers revolving credit facility and accrued interest in connection therewith. immediately following such repayment, no borrowings were outstanding under the issuers revolving credit facility. item 9.01. financial statements and exhibits (d) exhibits exhibit no. description 4.1 indenture, dated april 20, 2018, among fidelity guaranty & life holdings, inc., the

0.00% per annum and (b) the rate per annum obtained by dividing the london interbank offered rate by one minus the applicable reserve requirement. interest payments under the credit agreement are

months. the borrowers are required to pay an undrawn commitment fee at a rate per annum equal to 0.375% to 0.50% based upon the ratio of debt to total capitalization of cf bermuda of the undrawn portion of the commitments under the credit agreement computed on a daily basis. payments of the undrawn commitment fee are payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. the borrowers have the right at any time to prepay any borrowings and to terminate the commitments, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement. the credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this type that, among other things, and, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the credit agreement, limit or restrict the borrowers’ and borrowers’ subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness; incur or become subject to liens; dispose of assets; make

invalidity of the loan documents; the entry of judgments against the borrowers or their respective subsidiaries above a certain dollar threshold; the occurrence of certain erisa-related events; and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. if an event of default under the credit agreement occurs and is continuing, then the administrative agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the lenders holding a majority of the aggregate loans, letter of credit risk participations and unused revolving commitments then outstanding under the credit agreement, declare the obligations under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable, terminate the commitments thereunder and require cash collateralization of outstanding letters of credit; provided that the termination of commitments and acceleration of obligations and requirement to cash collateralize letters of credit will be automatic upon a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default of any borrower, bermuda re, fglic or any guarantor which beneficially owns capital stock in any of cf bermuda’s insurance subsidiaries. all obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured and are guaranteed pursuant to the

(2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the company or fgl following the announcement of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the merger, including due to failure to meet conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) delays in obtaining, adverse conditions contained in, or the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (including approval from insurance regulators) required to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (5) the ability to achieve tax and operational efficiencies or to achieve incremental investment returns from asset management; (6) the ability to identify and consummate accretive, value added acquisitions; (7) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the post-acquisition company’s ordinary shares on a stock exchange following the merger; (8) the risk that the merger disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the merger;

“forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “might” and “continues,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the company’s expectations and projections with respect to the completion of the business combination and the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreements. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside the company’s and fgl’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement relating to the business combination (the “merger agreement”); (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the company or fgl following the announcement of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of the company or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) delays in obtaining, adverse conditions contained in, or the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (including approval from insurance regulators) required to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (5) the ability to achieve tax and operational efficiencies or to achieve incremental investment returns from asset management; (6) the ability to identify and consummate accretive, value added acquisitions; (7) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the post-acquisition company’s ordinary shares on a stock exchange following the business combination; (8) the risk that the business combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the business combination; (9) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (10) costs related to the business combination; (11) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (12) the possibility that fgl or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (13) other risks and uncertainties identified in the company’s proxy statement relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and in the company’s and fgl’s other filings with the sec. the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. readers should not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. the company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, subject to applicable law. the information contained in any website referenced herein is not,

pursuant to the share purchase agreement described under item 8.01 herein, of which $23 million would be used to offset a portion of net redemptions, if any, by public 3 shareholders of the company in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the business combination and $9 million would be used to fund any fps shortfall. investor agreement as an inducement for each of bto fund, gso and fnf (collectively, the “investor agreement parties”) to enter into the limited guaranties (described above) in connection with the business combination, the company entered into an investor letter agreement, dated may 24, 2017, with the investor agreement parties (the “investor agreement”), pursuant to which the company agreed that, without the investor agreement parties’ prior written consent, the company would not amend, modify, grant any waiver of any condition under or seek to terminate any of the transaction agreements relating to the business combination, or take any action concerning settlements, stipulations or judgments with or by government authorities or make any regulatory filings contemplated by the merger agreement, subject in each case to certain exceptions and qualifications. pursuant to the investor agreement, the terms of the equity to be issued pursuant to the equity commitment letters will be as follows: ·with respect to the bto fund commitment under the bto fund equity commitment letters and the forward purchase backstop equity commitment letters, bto fund will purchase ordinary shares of the company. ·with respect to the fnf commitment described in the fnf equity commitment letters, fnf will purchase (i) $135 million of ordinary shares for $10.00 per share, and (ii) $100 million of preferred shares, plus additional amounts, if any, pursuant to fnf’s commitment to offset a portion of the redemptions of the company’s ordinary shares and warrants on the terms as set forth in the term sheet attached to that certain gso side letter (as defined below). ·in the event that holders of ordinary shares redeem their shares in connection with the business combination, a certain portion of the gso commitment and the fnf commitment, as described in their respective commitment letters, shall be allocated pro rata based on their aggregate commitments thereunder. the investor agreement further provides that the investor agreement parties will receive registration rights on customary terms with respect to the ordinary shares, preferred shares and warrants (and the ordinary shares underlying such warrants) issued pursuant to the equity commitment letters. gso side letter on may 24, 2017, the company entered into a side letter agreement with gso (the “gso side letter”), which provides that the preferred shares to be issued to gso and fnf under the gso side letter and the investor agreement, respectively, will have a 30-year maturity, a dividend rate of 7.5% per annum, payable quarterly in cash or additional preferred shares of the company, at the company’s option, and will not be convertible into ordinary shares of the company. in the event that any material indebtedness of the company or any of its subsidiaries is accelerated, the dividend rate on all preferred shares will increase incrementally by 2.0%. from the tenth anniversary of the funding date, upon gso’s request, the company is required (subject to customary black-out provisions) to re-market the preferred equity on customary terms. the company must offer the re-marketed equity with (i) a dividend rate up to 10-year treasury rate plus up to 8%; and (ii) up to 7 years of non-call protection. to the extent market conditions make such re-marketing impracticable, the company may temporarily delay such re-marketing provided that the preferred equity is re-marketed within six months of the date of gso’ initial request. if the proceeds from any sales resulting from such marketing are less than the outstanding balance of the applicable preferred shares (including dividends paid in kind and unpaid accrued dividends), the company will issue common equity to the holders of the preferred shares with an aggregate value (calculated at a 8% discount to the 30-day vwap) equal to such difference. in the event that preferred equity is issued pursuant to gso’s and fnf’s backstop commitments, and only if such backstop commitments are funded, pursuant to their respective equity commitment letters, the gso side letter and the investor agreement, then the dividend rate on all preferred shares will increase incrementally and ratably up to maximum of 12.0% on the following dates: first, on the funding date of the purchase of such preferred equity; second, on the six month anniversary of such funding date; and third, on the twelve month anniversary of such funding date. the preferred shares will be callable at any time by the company, subject to specified multiples on invested capital. the terms of the preferred equity are expected to include customary covenants for senior preferred equity, including limitations on debt incurrence, equity issuances and payments of dividends. the preferred equity will rank senior in priority to all other existing and future equity securities of the company with respect to distribution rights and liquidation preference. in addition, holders of preferred equity are expected to have board observation and customary registration rights with respect to such shares. pursuant to the gso side letter, for the period from the date of the gso side letter until the earlier of (a) the mutual agreement by the parties thereto not to execute definitive documentation relating to the gso commitment, (b) the closing date, and (c) the first anniversary of the gso side letter, the company agreed (i) not to, directly or indirectly solicit, participate in any negotiations or discussion with or provide or afford access to information to any third party with respect to, or otherwise effect, facilitate, encourage or accept any offers for the purchase or provision of the preferred equity to be issued to gso pursuant to the gso commitment letters (the “gso preferred equity”) or any alternative equity or debt financing arrangements, in each case, to be put in place in connection with the business combination in replacement of the gso 4 preferred equity or any portion thereof (other than pursuant to the equity commitment letters, forward purchase agreements or the debt commitment letter), and (ii) if the business combination is not consummated and the company pursues an alternative transaction with fgl within the period ending on the first anniversary of the gso side letter, and another financing source or institution proposes to provide financing in connection with such alternative transaction, the company will provide gso a reasonable opportunity to provide such financing in lieu of any other financing source or institution on equivalent terms. gso fee letter
