company of a business combination. as indicated in the company’s final prospectus, dated august 15, 2017, upon consummation of a business combination, the lenders would have the option to convert up to $1,500,000 of the principal balance of such notes into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant (subject to compliance with the terms of that certain agreement and plan of merger, dated as of april

restricts the company’s ability to convert such loans to warrants except in certain cases). the terms of any such warrants issued would be identical to the warrants issued by the company in its initial public offering (“public offering”) except that such warrants would be non-redeemable by the company and would be exercisable for cash or on a “cashless” basis, in each case, so long as such warrants were held by the initial holder or his permitted transferees. if a business combination is not consummated, all outstanding amounts under any notes issued to the lenders would be forgiven except to the extent that the company had funds available to it outside of its trust account established in connection with the public offering to repay such amounts. item 9.01. financial statements

exchange act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. press release attached as exhibit 99.1 to this report is the press release issued by the parties related to the proposed transactions. investor meetings attached as exhibit 99.2 to this report is the form of investor presentation to be used by capitol in presentations to certain of its shareholders and other persons interested in purchasing ordinary shares of capitol. additional information commencing shortly after the filing of this current report on form 8-k, capitol intends to hold presentations for certain of its shareholders, as well as other persons who might be interested in purchasing capitol’s securities, in connection with the proposed transactions with nesco, as described in this report. this current report on form 8-k, including some or all of the exhibits hereto, will be distributed to participants at such presentations. 6 capitol and nesco and their respective directors and executive officers, under sec rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of capitol’s shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions. investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names and interests in the proposed transactions of capitol’s directors and officers in capitol’s filings with the sec, including capitol’s annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, which was filed with the sec on march 4, 2019. information regarding the persons who may, under sec rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to capitol’s shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions will be set forth in the registration statement for the proposed transactions when

that capitol intends to file with the sec. investors and security holders of capitol and nesco are urged to read the proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents that will be filed with the sec carefully and in their entirety when they become available because they will contain important information about the proposed transactions. investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and other documents containing important information about capitol and nesco once such documents are filed with the sec, through the website maintained by

written request to capitol investment corp. iv, 1300 17th street, suite 820, arlington, virginia 22209 or by emailing info@capinvestment.com. some of nesco’s financial information and data contained herein and in the exhibits hereto does not conform to sec regulation s-x in that it includes certain financial information not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles (“gaap”). accordingly, such information and data will be adjusted and presented differently in capitol’s filings with the sec. capitol and nesco believe that the presentation of non-gaap measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the ability of nesco to meet capital expenditures and working capital requirements and otherwise meet its obligations as they become due. the financial projections included in this report and the exhibits hereto are forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond capitol’s and nesco’s control. while all projections are necessarily speculative, capitol and nesco believe that the prospective financial information covering periods beyond twelve months from its date of preparation carries increasingly higher levels of uncertainty and should be read in that context. there will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially greater or materially less than those contained in the projections. the inclusion of projections in this report and the exhibit hereto should not be regarded as an indication that capitol and nesco, or their representatives, considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events. 7 additional information and forward-looking statements this report and the exhibits hereto are not a proxy statement or solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the proposed transactions and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of capitol or nesco, nor shall there be any sale of any such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. this report and the exhibits hereto include “forward-looking statements”. actual results may differ from expectations, estimates and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. neither capitol nor nesco undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. important factors, among others, that may affect actual results include nesco’s ability to execute on its business plans and nesco’s estimates of expenses and future revenues and profitability. other factors include the possibility that the proposed transactions do not close, including due to the failure to receive required security holder approvals, or the failure of other closing conditions. this report and the exhibits hereto are not intended to be all-inclusive or to contain all the information that a person may desire in considering an investment in capitol and is not intended to form the basis of any investment decision in capitol. 8 additional information concerning these and other risk factors will be contained in capitol’s filings with the sec. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning capitol and nesco, the proposed transactions or other matters and attributable to capitol and nesco or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. neither capitol nor nesco undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release
