statements this current report on form 8-k contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.

similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. these statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to the company’s and shift’s future prospects, developments and business strategies. in particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning the timing of the merger; the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the public company once the transaction is complete, and shift’s estimated and future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth opportunities. these statements are based on the company’s or shift’s management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. such forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside the company’s or shift’s control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors include, but are not limited to, (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (2) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of the company or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (3) the ability of the public entity to meet nasdaq’s listing standards following the merger; (4) the inability to complete the private placement; (5) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of shift as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions described herein; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with suppliers and agents and retain its management and key employees; (7) costs related to the proposed transaction; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations and delays in obtaining, adverse conditions contained in, or the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals required to complete the potential transaction; (9) the possibility that shift may be adversely affected by other economic, business, regulatory and/or competitive factors; (10) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the company, shift or any of their respective directors or officers, following the announcement of the potential transaction; and (11) the failure to realize anticipated pro forma results and underlying assumptions, including with respect to estimated stockholder redemptions and purchase price and other adjustments. 4 additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements can be found in the company’s most recent annual report on form 10-k, subsequently filed quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k, which are available, free of charge, at the sec’s website at www.sec.gov, and will also be provided in the registration statement on form s-4 and the company’s proxy statement/prospectus when available. new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and the company and shift undertake no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. this communication is not intended to be all-inclusive or to contain all the information that a person may desire in considering an investment in the company and is not intended to form the basis of an investment decision in the company. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the company and shift, the proposed transaction or other matters and attributable to the company and shift or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. disclaimer this communication shall neither constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which
