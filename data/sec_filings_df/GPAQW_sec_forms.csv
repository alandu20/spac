the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the parties once the transaction is complete, and holding’s, the company’s and hofv’s estimated and future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth opportunities, relating to the acquired business. these forward-looking statements reflect the current analysis of existing information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. as a result, caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. due to known and unknown risks, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations or projections. the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the impact of the coronavirus on gpaq and hofv, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement and the proposed transaction contemplated thereby; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of the company or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement;

the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the parties once the transaction is complete, and holding’s, the company’s and hofv’s estimated and future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth opportunities, relating to the acquired business. these forward-looking statements reflect the current analysis of existing information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. as a result, caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. due to known and unknown risks, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations or projections. the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of the company to the proposed additional extension of the deadline within which to complete the proposed business combination; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement and the proposed transaction contemplated thereby; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of the company or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been, or will be, instituted against the company or other parties to the merger agreement following announcement of the merger agreement and transactions contemplated therein; the ability of holding’s to meet nasdaq listing standards following the merger and in connection with the consummation thereof; the failure to obtain the financing arrangements necessary to complete the development of the project; the failure to achieve the assumptions underlying certain of the financial projections included within the investor presentation including, among others, securing the timely financing for, and achieving construction of, the second phase of the project within assumed time and financial budget, and achieving expected attendance and occupancy rates; risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the announcement of the merger agreement and consummation of the transaction described therein; costs related to the proposed merger and the impact of the substantial indebtedness to be incurred to finance the consummation of the merger; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the ability of the combined company to meet its financial and strategic goals, due to, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitability, maintain relationships with customers and retain its key employees; the possibility that the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in other reports and other public filings with the sec by the company and holdings. use of non-gaap financial measures the investor presentation includes non-gaap financial measures of the combined company including forward-looking projections of adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda. in the investor presentation, “ebitda” means net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. “adjusted ebitda” means ebitda adjusted for items that are not part of regular operating activities, including acquisition related expenses, profit interest expense and founder’s fee (both of which will cease following closing of the merger) and other non-cash items such as non-cash-unit based compensation, losses on disposal of property, losses from discontinued operations and individually significant disposals and expenses related to tax changes. adjusted ebitda does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with gaap. “annualized run-rate ebitda” means “ebitda” projected over an annualized period. we have presented forward-looking projections of adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda in the investor presentation because we consider them key measures used by the combined company management to understand and evaluate the combined company’s operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve the combined company’s annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans, and believe that those measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda differently than we do. hofv and gpaq are unable to reconcile the forward-looking projections of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda to their nearest gaap measures because the nearest gaap financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. participants in the solicitation the company, holdings, hofv, newco and their respective directors, executive officers and other members of their management and employees, under sec rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of the company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination. investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and interests in the company’s directors in its annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, which was filed with the sec on march 18, 2019, and also in the registration statement on form s-4 filed with the sec on november 12, 2019, which includes the proxy statement/prospectus of gpaq for the proposed transaction. information regarding the persons who may, under sec rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to the company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination, and information concerning the interests of the company’s and newco’s participants in the solicitation, which may, in some cases, be different than those of the company’s and newco’s equity holders generally, is set forth in the registration statement on form s-4 filed with the sec on november 12, 2019. non-solicitation this communication is not a proxy statement or solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the proposed transaction and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of any such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. no offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10 of the securities act of 1933, as amended. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

the possibility that the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in other reports and other public filings with the sec by gpaq and holdings. use of non-gaap financial measures the investor presentation includes non-gaap financial measures of the combined company including forward-looking projections of adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda. in the investor presentation, “ebitda” means net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. “adjusted ebitda” means ebitda adjusted for items that are not part of regular operating activities, including acquisition related expenses, profit interest expense and founder’s fee (both of which will cease following closing of the merger) and other non-cash items such as non-cash-unit based compensation, losses on disposal of property, losses from discontinued operations and individually significant disposals and expenses related to tax changes. adjusted ebitda does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with gaap. “annualized run-rate ebitda” means “ebitda” projected over an annualized period. we have presented forward-looking projections of adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda in the investor presentation because we consider them key measures used by the combined company management to understand and evaluate the combined company’s operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve the combined company’s annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans, and believe that those measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda differently than we do. hofv and gpaq are unable to reconcile the forward-looking projections of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda to their nearest gaap measures because the nearest gaap financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. participants in the solicitation gpaq, holdings, hofv, newco and their respective directors, executive officers and other members of their management and employees, under sec rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of gpaq stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination. investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and interests in gpaq’s directors in its annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, which was filed with the sec on march 18, 2019. information regarding the persons who may, under sec rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to gpaq’s stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination will be set forth in the proxy statement for the proposed business combination when available. information concerning the interests of gpaq’s and newco’s participants in the solicitation, which may, in some cases, be different than those of gpaq’s and newco’s equity holders generally, will be set forth in the proxy statement relating to the proposed business combination when it becomes available. 2 non-solicitation this communication is not a proxy statement or solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the proposed transaction and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of any such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. no offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10 of the securities act of 1933, as amended. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the parties once the transaction is complete, and holding’s, gpaq’s and hofv’s estimated and future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth opportunities, relating to the acquired business. these forward-looking statements reflect the current analysis of existing information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. as a result, caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. due to known and unknown risks, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations or projections. the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement and the proposed transaction contemplated thereby; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of gpaq or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been, or will be, instituted against gpaq or other parties to the merger agreement following announcement of the merger agreement and transactions contemplated therein; the ability of holding’s to meet nasdaq listing standards following the merger and in connection with the consummation thereof; the failure to obtain the financing arrangements necessary to complete the development of the project; the failure to achieve the assumptions underlying certain of the financial projections included within the investor presentation including, among others, securing the timely financing for, and achieving construction of, the second phase of the project within assumed time and financial budget, and achieving expected attendance and occupancy rates; risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the announcement of the merger agreement and consummation of the transaction described therein; costs related to the proposed merger and the impact of the substantial indebtedness to be incurred to finance the consummation of the merger; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the ability of the combined company to meet its financial and strategic goals, due to, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitability, maintain relationships with customers and retain its key employees; the possibility that the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in other reports and other public filings with the sec by gpaq and holdings. use of non-gaap financial measures the press release and investor presentation include non-gaap financial measures of the combined company including forward-looking projections of adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda. in the press release and investor presentation, “ebitda” means net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. “adjusted ebitda” means ebitda adjusted for items that are not part of regular operating activities, including acquisition related expenses, profit interest expense and founder’s fee (both of which will cease following closing of the merger) and other non-cash items such as non-cash-unit based compensation, losses on disposal of property, losses from discontinued operations and individually significant disposals and expenses related to tax changes. adjusted ebitda does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with gaap. “annualized run-rate ebitda” means “ebitda” projected over an annualized period. we have presented forward-looking projections of adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda in the press release and investor presentation because we consider them key measures used by the combined company management to understand and evaluate the combined company’s operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve the combined company’s annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans, and believe that those measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda differently than we do. hofv and gpaq are unable to reconcile the forward-looking projections of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda to their nearest gaap measures because the nearest gaap financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. participants in the solicitation gpaq, holdings, hofv, newco and their respective directors, executive officers and other members of their management and employees, under sec rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of gpaq stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination. investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and interests in gpaq’s directors in its annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, which was filed with the sec on march 18, 2019. information regarding the persons who may, under sec rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to gpaq’s stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination will be set forth in the proxy statement for the proposed business combination when available. information concerning the interests of gpaq’s and newco’s participants in the solicitation, which may, in some cases, be different than those of gpaq’s and newco’s equity holders generally, will be set forth in the proxy statement relating to the proposed business combination when it becomes available. 6 non-solicitation this communication is not a proxy statement or solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the proposed transaction and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of any such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. no offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10 of the securities act of 1933, as amended. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

completion of the transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive merger agreement and satisfaction of the conditions therein, including approval of the transaction by the

press release dated august 5, 2019 is attached as exhibit 99.3 hereto, each of which is incorporated into this item 8.01 by reference. 1 forward-looking statements certain statements made herein are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “plan”, “outlook”, and “project” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. such forward-looking statements include timing of the proposed merger; the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the parties once the transaction is complete, and the company’s and hofv’s estimated and future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth opportunities, relating to the acquired business. these forward-looking statements reflect the current analysis of existing information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. as a result, caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. due to known and unknown risks, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations or projections. the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the terms of the agreement in principle not hereafter being memorialized in a definitive agreement; matters discovered by the company or hofv as they complete their respective due diligence investigation of the other; the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been, or will be, instituted against the company or other parties to the agreement in principle following announcement of the agreement in principle and transactions contemplated therein; the ability of the company to meet nasdaq listing standards following the merger and in connection with the consummation thereof; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the agreement in principle due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of the company or other conditions to closing in the agreement in principle; the failure to obtain the financing arrangements necessary to complete the development of the project; the failure to achieve the assumptions underlying certain of the financial projections included within the investor presentation including, among others, securing the timely financing for, and achieving construction of, any future planned phase of the project within assumed time and financial budget, and achieving expected attendance and occupancy rates; risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the announcement of the agreement in principle and consummation of the transaction described therein; costs related to the proposed merger and the impact of the substantial indebtedness to be incurred to finance the consummation of the merger; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the ability of the combined company to meet its financial and strategic goals, due to, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitability, maintain relationships with customers and retain its key employees; the possibility that the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in other reports and other public filings with the securities and exchange commission (the “sec”) by the company. in addition, the allocation of equity in the newly merged public company identified in the investor presentation assumes that there will be approximately $114.3 million in the company trust account at closing, which itself assumes no material redemptions prior to the closing absent corresponding equity financing. further, the portions of the press release containing forward-looking statements and the investor presentation were prepared based on information provided by hofv, which has not been independently verified by the company and no representation or warranty, express or implied, is provided in relation to the fairness, accuracy, correctness, completeness or reliability of the information, opinions or conclusions expressed therein. additional information concerning these and other factors that may impact our expectations and projections can be found in our periodic filings with the sec, including our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, form 10-q for the quarterly period ended march 31, 2018, the definitive proxy statement filed by the company with the sec on june 18, 2019 pursuant to which a special meeting of the company’s stockholders was conducted and at which stockholders approved an extension of the date by which the company had to consummate a business combination from july 30, 2019 to october 31, 2019, plus up to three additional 30-day extensions thereafter (the “extension proxy”), the current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on july 26, 2019 announcing the approval of the matters covered in the extension proxy, and in the proxy statement to be filed by the company regarding the transaction memorialized in the agreement in principle with the sec when available. the company’s sec filings are available publicly on the sec’s website at www.sec.gov. the company disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. use of non-gaap financial measures the investor presentation includes non-gaap financial measures of hofv including forward-looking projections of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda. in the investor presentation, “ebitda” means net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. “adjusted ebitda” means ebitda adjusted for items that are not part of regular operating activities, including acquisition related expenses, profit interest expense and founder’s fee (both of which will cease following closing of the merger) and other non-cash items such as non-cash-unit based compensation, losses on disposal of property, losses from discontinued operations and individually significant disposals and expenses related to tax changes. adjusted ebitda does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with gaap. “annualized run-rate ebitda” means ""ebitda"" projected over an annualized period. we have presented forward-looking projections of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda in the investor presentation because we consider them key measures used by hofv management to understand and evaluate hofv’s operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve hofv’s annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans, and believe that those measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. other companies may calculate ebitda, adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda differently than we do. hofv and gpaq are unable to reconcile the forward-looking projections of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and annualized run-rate ebitda to their nearest gaap measures because the nearest gaap financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. 2 disclaimer this communication shall neither constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. additional information about the transaction and where to find it in connection with the proposed transaction, the company will file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and will mail a definitive proxy statement and other relevant documents to its stockholders. investors and security holders of the company are advised to read, when available, the preliminary proxy statement, and amendments thereto, and the definitive proxy statement in connection with the company’s solicitation of proxies for its stockholders’ meeting to be held to approve the proposed transaction because the proxy statement will contain important information about the proposed transaction and the parties thereto. the definitive proxy statement will be mailed to stockholders of the company as of a record date to be established for voting on the proposed transaction. stockholders will also be able to obtain copies of the proxy statement, without charge, once available, at the sec’s website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: gordon pointe acquisition corp., 780 fifth avenue south, naples, fl 34102. participants in solicitation the company and its directors, executive officers and other members of its management and employees, under sec rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of the company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed transaction. investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and interests in the company of the company’s directors and officers in the company’s filings with the sec. information regarding the persons who may, under sec rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to the company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed transaction will be set forth in the proxy statement for the proposed transaction when available. information concerning the interests of the company’s participants in the solicitation, which may, in some cases, be different than those of the company’s stockholders generally, will be set forth in the proxy statement relating to the proposed transaction when it becomes available. item
