(the apx board) adopted an incentive compensation plan (the cash bonus plan). the cash bonus plan allowed the compensation committee of the apx board to provide annual cash incentive awards to selected employees, including our neos, based upon performance goals established by the committee. on february 29, 2020, the company assumed the cash bonus plan and granted the authority to administer the cash bonus plan to the compensation committee of the board (the committee). in 2019, pursuant to the cash bonus plan, the neos were eligible to receive an annual cash incentive award, 75% of which was based on achievements of performance objectives determined by the committee. as provided in their respective employment agreements, the target bonus amount for each of messrs. pedersen and dunn was 100% of his base salary at the end of the performance period minus $300,000 and the target bonus amount for each of messrs. davies, eyring and santiago was 60% of his base salary at the end of the performance period; the target bonus amount for mr. gerard was 50% of his salary earned during the performance period. to ensure the focus and accountability of the neos on and for their varying responsibilities within the organization, the committee determined to apply different performance measures depending on the neos responsibilities. for the neos at the corporate level (messrs. pedersen, dunn, davies and gerard), 75% of the bonus opportunity was based on company-wide goals. for the neos who are heads of our business units (bus) (messrs. eyring and santiago), 60% of the bonus opportunity was based on business unit specific goals and 15% of the bonus opportunity was based on company-wide goals. for all of the neos, 25% of the bonus opportunity was discretionary as the committee determined to retain discretion to reward other company accomplishments not anticipated at the beginning of the year. the actual bonus amounts to be paid to the neos at the corporate level for fiscal 2019 performance was calculated by multiplying each neos bonus potential target by a weighted achievement factor based on our actual achievement relative to the company-wide performance objectives and the discretionary component. the committee chose performance metrics that are indicators of our strategic growth and the strength of our overall financial results. the company-wide performance objectives were company-wide adjusted ebitda (defined as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash compensation, mdr fees, and certain other non-recurring expenses or gains) (15% of the total award opportunity) and the weighted average of the business unit-level performance objectives, as described in greater detail below (60% of the total award opportunity). the business unit performance objectives consisted of subscriber lifetime value growth (defined as the product of new subscribers, service margin and average customer life, plus ltv upgrade revenues, less net subscriber acquisition costs and customer financing fees), service cost (defined as the average monthly service costs incurred during the period (both period and capitalized service costs), including monitoring, customer service, field service and other service support costs, less total non-recurring smart home services billings for the period divided by average monthly total subscribers for the same period), attrition (defined as the aggregate number of cancelled smart home and security subscribers during the prior 12 month period divided by the monthly weighted average number of total subscribers based on the total subscribers at the beginning and end of each month of a given period. subscribers are considered canceled when they terminate in accordance with the terms of their contract, are terminated by us or if payment from such subscribers is deemed uncollectible. if a sale of a service contract to third parties occurs, or a subscriber relocates but continues their service, we do not consider this as a cancellation. if a subscriber transfers their service contract to a new subscriber, we do not consider this as a cancellation) and the achievement of certain milestones associated with business unit initiatives. the achievement factor with respect to the business unit objectives for the neos at the corporate level were calculated as the weighted average of (1) the weighted average of the achievement factors associated with the actual achievement of our direct to home, inside sales and customer experience business units against the subscriber lifetime value growth targets for such business units (44% of the total award opportunity), (2) the achievement factor associated with the actual achievement of our customer experience business unit against the service cost target (6% of the total award opportunity), (3) the achievement factor associated with the actual achievement of our customer experience business unit against the attrition target (4% of the total award opportunity), (4) the weighted average of the achievement factors associated with the actual achievement of our retail and customer experience business units against certain milestones, as described in greater detail below (6% of the total award opportunity). the table below sets forth the weighting of each component of the annual incentive award opportunity for the neos at the corporate level: weighting weighted average business unit performance subscriber lifetime value growth 44 % service cost 6 % attrition 4 % initiatives/pilot lifetime value 6 % company-wide performance company-wide adjusted ebitda 15 % board discretion 25 % total 100 % the achievement factor with respect to the company-wide adjusted ebitda component was determined by calculating our actual achievement against the company-wide adjusted ebitda performance target based on the pre-established scale set forth in the following table: % attainment of performance target achievementfactor less than 95% 0 95% 50 % 100% 100 % 105% 150 % 110% 200 % 115% 250 % 120% or greater 300 % based on the pre-established scale set forth above, no cash incentive amount would be paid to the neos with respect to the company-wide adjusted ebitda component of the award unless our actual performance for 2019 was at or above 95% of the performance target. if performance was 120% or more of the performance target, then the achievement factor with respect to the company-wide adjusted ebitda component of the award would be a maximum of 300%. for performance percentages between the levels set forth in the table above, the resulting achievement factor would be adjusted on a linear basis. the company-wide adjusted ebitda performance target for 2019 was $410 million. the achievement factor with respect to the business unit-level performance objective components were determined by calculating the weighted average of our business units actual achievement against the targets set for such business units. for our direct to home, inside sales and customer experience business units, the achievement factors were based on the pre-established scale set forth in the following table: direct to home inside sales customer experience subscriberlifetime valuegrowth as apercentage oftarget(60%)(1) subscriberlifetime valuegrowth as apercentage oftarget(60%)(1)

each of the business units, the resulting achievement factor would be adjusted on a linear basis. the committee believes that the direct to home, inside sales and customer experience performance targets provided reasonably achievable, but challenging, goals for the participants at those business units. the achievement factor associated with the performance of our retail business unit was based on such business units accomplishment of certain key milestones related to subscriber growth from expansion into additional retail partners and lead generation sources, achieving certain cost and cash flow targets, and achieving stated milestones associated with new products and channels. these milestones were not assigned any particular weightings. accordingly, the committee determined the achievement factor based on the overall achievement of our retail business unit against the various key milestones, with the weighting of the milestones determined in the committees discretion. the committee believes that the retail business unit performance objectives provided reasonably achievable, but challenging, goals for mr. santiago and other participants at the retail business unit. no cash incentive amount would be paid to the neos at the corporate level with respect to the business unit component of the award unless at least one business units actual achievement was at or above the minimum level of performance corresponding to an achievement factor above 0 with respect to at least one of such business units targets. the achievement factor associated with the business unit component of the award would be a maximum of 300% for significant outperformance. the actual bonus amounts to be paid to mr. eyring for fiscal 2019 performance were calculated by multiplying his bonus potential target by a weighted achievement factor based on our actual achievement relative to the company-wide adjusted ebitda objective, the achievement of our inside sales business unit relative to the inside sales performance objectives, as described in greater detail above, and the discretionary component. the table below sets forth the weighting of each component of the annual incentive award opportunity for mr. eyring: weighting inside sales business unit performance subscriber lifetime value growth 60 % company-wide performance company-wide adjusted ebitda 15 % board

consideration of the achievement of other objectives in 2019, including but not limited to the launch of multiple retail partnerships and the successful completion of the companys transaction with mosaic acquisition corp., determined to adjust mr. santiagos weighted achievement factor to 100%. in addition, the committee in its discretion determined to adjust mr. gerards weighted achievement factor to 146% in light of his successful leadership as interim chief financial officer, while simultaneously leading the companys treasury function and its transaction with mosaic acquisition corp.

(5) in connection with his departure from the company in october 2019, mr. davies forfeited his 2019 management bonus. ceo pay ratio as required by section 953(b) of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, and item 402(u) of regulation s-k (item 402(u)), the company is providing the following reasonable estimate of the ratio of the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees except todd r. pedersen, our ceo, to the annual total compensation of mr. pedersen, calculated in a manner consistent with item 402(u). for 2019, our last completed fiscal year:  the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, excluding our ceo, was $34,973.  the annual total compensation of our ceo was $2,598,381. based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our ceo to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees except our ceo was 74 to 1. we determined that, as of december 31, 2019, our employee population consisted of approximately 11,440 u.s. employees and approximately 484 non-u.s. employees all of whom were located in canada. as permitted by item 402(u), we excluded from our employee population for purposes of identifying our median employee the approximately 484 non-u.s. employees located in canada, who comprised in the aggregate of approximately 4.2% of our of our total employees as of december 31, 2019. our resulting employee population consisted of: approximately 4,182 direct sellers, whose compensation is entirely commission-based and who work primarily during the period from april to august; approximately 5,424 regular full-time and part-time employees; approximately 1,340 seasonal employees, whose compensation is primarily based on the number of installations they perform and who work primarily during the period from april to august; and approximately 494 of other commission-based employees. to identify our median employee from this employee population, we obtained from our internal employee tax records total income paid in 2019 to each employee in the employee population, as reported in the 2019 tax form applicable to such employee. we believe this consistently applied compensation measure reasonably reflects annual compensation across our employee base. we annualized the total income amounts paid to any permanent employees in the employee population who were employed by us for less than the full fiscal year. we then ranked the resulting income paid to all of the employees in the employee population other than our ceo to determine our median employee. once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employees compensation for 2019 in accordance with the requirements of item 402(c)(2)(x) of regulation s-k for the summary compensation table. with respect to the annual total compensation of our ceo, we used the amount reported in the total column of our summary compensation table set forth above. item 7.01 regulation fd disclosure. on march 3, 2020, the company issued a press release regarding certain changes in senior management of the company. the press

(the issuer or the borrower), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of vivint smart home, inc. (the company or vivint), issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior secured notes due 2027 (the notes), pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 14, 2020 (the indenture), among the issuer, the guarantors party thereto (the guarantors) and wilmington trust, national association, as trustee (the trustee) and collateral agent. concurrently with the notes offering, the issuer amended and restated the credit agreements governing its existing revolving credit facility and existing term loan facility (the concurrent refinancing transactions). in connection therewith, the issuer, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date with respect to certain commitments under the revolving credit facility and increased the aggregate commitments in respect of the revolving credit facility to $350.0 million and (ii) incurred $950.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans. vivint used the net proceeds from the notes offering and concurrent refinancing transactions, together with the proceeds from its previously announced merger with mosaic acquisition corp. completed on january 17, 2020, to (i) redeem all of the issuers outstanding 8.750% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 notes redemption), (ii) redeem all of the issuers outstanding 8.875% senior secured notes due 2022 (the 2022 private placement notes redemption), (iii) refinance in full the existing borrowings under the issuers existing term loan facility and revolving credit facility, (iv) redeem $223.0 million aggregate principal amount of the issuers outstanding 7.875% senior secured notes due 2022 (the existing 7.875% notes redemption and, together with the 2020 notes redemption and the 2022 private placement notes redemption, the redemptions) and (v) pay the related accrued interest, fees and expenses related thereto. the issuer irrevocably deposited funds with the applicable trustee and/or paying agent to effect the redemptions and to satisfy and discharge all of the issuers remaining obligations under the indenture governing the issuers 8.750% senior notes due 2020 and the note purchase agreement governing the issuers 8.875% senior secured notes due 2022. vivint intends to use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of additional indebtedness. senior secured notes due 2027 the following is a brief description of the terms of the notes and the indenture. capitalized terms used herein, but not defined herein, will have the meanings given to them in the indenture. interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year, commencing on august 15, 2020. interest on the notes will accrue from and including february 14, 2020. the notes will mature on february 15, 2027, or on such earlier date as a result of the operation of certain springing maturity date provisions set forth in the indenture. ranking the notes and the guarantees thereof are the issuers and the guarantors senior secured obligations and rank:  equally in right of payment with all of the issuers and the guarantors existing and future senior obligations (without giving effect to security interests); and  senior in right of payment to any of the issuers and the guarantors obligations that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes. the notes and the guarantees thereof will be effectively senior to any future indebtedness of the issuer that is unsecured or secured by liens on collateral that are junior to the liens securing the notes, in each case, to the extent of the value of the collateral (after giving effect to liens securing the priority payment lien obligations and any other lien on the collateral). the notes and the guarantees thereof will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of the issuers subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. guarantees and collateral the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis, by apx group holdings, inc., the direct parent of the issuer and the direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the company (holdings), and each of the issuers existing restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the issuers revolving credit facility, term loan facility and the issuers existing senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes. the issuers existing and future foreign subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the notes. these guarantees are subject to release under specified circumstances. the notes are secured, on a pari passu basis, by the collateral securing obligations under the issuers existing senior secured notes, the revolving credit facility and term loan facility, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. under the terms of the security documents and the intercreditor agreement, the proceeds of any collection, sale, disposition or other realization of collateral received in connection with the exercise of remedies 1 (including distributions of cash, securities or other property on account of the value of the collateral in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceedings) will be applied first to repay superpriority obligations, including borrowings under the issuers revolving credit facility, and any additional superpriority borrowings that the issuer is permitted to incur in the future. optional redemption the issuer may, at its

(the company or vivint), and certain of apxs subsidiaries, the following preliminary unaudited financial results of apx for the quarter and fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 will be provided to potential investors. for the quarter ended december 31, 2019, the companys total revenues are estimated to be between $299 million and $314 million, net loss is estimated to be between $80 million and $95 million, and covenant adjusted ebitda is estimated to be between $158 million and $173 million. for the year ended december 31, 2019, the companys total revenues are estimated to be between $1,148 million and $1,163 million, net loss is estimated to be between $387 million and $402 million, and covenant adjusted ebitda is estimated to be between $632 million and $647 million. the selected preliminary financial data in this current report on form 8-k has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, the management of the company. the information and estimates have not been compiled or examined by the companys independent auditors and are subject to revision as the company prepares its financial statements as of and for the quarter and year ended december 31, 2019. because the company has not completed its normal quarterly closing and review procedures for the quarter and year ended december 31, 2019, and subsequent events may occur that require adjustments to these results, there can be no assurance that the final results for the quarter and year ended december 31, 2019 will not differ materially from these estimates. these estimates should not be viewed as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap or as a measure of performance. in addition, these estimated results for the quarter and year ended december 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for any future period. the information in this current report on form 8-k is being furnished pursuant to items 2.02 and 7.01 of form 8-k and shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of section 18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the exchange act), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing made by the company under the securities act of 1933 or the exchange act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. forward-looking statements this current report on form 8-k includes forward-looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 regarding, among other things, statements with respect to certain preliminary unaudited financial results for the companys quarter and year ended december 31, 2019, which are subject to finalization and contingencies associated with the companys quarterly financial and accounting procedures. these statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management. although the company believes that its plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, the company cannot assure you that it will achieve or realize these plans, intentions or expectations. forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning the companys possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. these statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words believes, estimates, expects, projects, forecasts, may, will, should, seeks, plans, scheduled, anticipates or intends or similar expressions. 1 forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. you should not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of the date hereof. you should understand that the following important factors, among others, could affect the companys future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forward-looking statements:  the risk that the recently consummated merger with mosaic acquisition corp. (the merger) disrupts the companys plans and operations;  the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of the combined business to grow and manage growth profitably;  costs related to the merger;  risks of the smart home and security industry, including risks of and publicity surrounding the sales, subscriber origination and retention process;  the highly competitive nature of the smart home and security industry and product introductions and promotional activity by the companys competitors;  litigation, complaints, product liability claims and/or adverse publicity;  the impact of changes in consumer spending patterns, consumer preferences, local, regional, and national economic conditions, crime, weather, demographic trends and employee availability;  increases and/or decreases in utility and other energy costs, increased costs related to utility or governmental requirements;  cost increases or shortages in smart home and security technology products or components;  the introduction of unsuccessful new smart home services;  privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or the loss of data;  the impact to the companys business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory compliance and customer experience of the vivint flex pay plan and the companys ability to successfully compete in retail sales channels; and  risks related to the companys exposure to variable rates of interest with respect to the companys revolving credit facility and term loan facility. in addition, the origination and retention of new subscribers will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, market availability, subscriber interest, the availability of suitable components, the negotiation of acceptable contract terms with subscribers, local permitting, licensing and regulatory compliance, and the companys ability to manage anticipated expansion and to hire, train and retain personnel, the financial viability of subscribers and general economic conditions. these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements in this current report on form 8-k are more fully described in the risk factors section in the companys proxy statement/consent solicitation statement/prospectus dated december 26, 2019, filed with the securities exchange commission (sec), as such factors may be updated from time to 2 time in the companys periodic filings with the sec, which are available on the secs website at www.sec.gov. the risks described in risk factors are not exhaustive. new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can the company assess the impact of all such risk factors on its business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. all forward-looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. the company undertakes no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. non-gaap financial measures covenant adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (gaap). covenant adjusted ebitda is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense (net of interest income), income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization (including amortization of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, stock based compensation and certain unusual, non-cash, nonrecurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations under the debt agreements governing the companys existing indebtedness. the company believes that the presentation of covenant adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants under the agreements governing the companys existing indebtedness. the company cautions investors that amounts presented in accordance with the companys definition of covenant adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate covenant adjusted ebitda in the same manner. covenant adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of the companys financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the companys liquidity. 3 see the following table for a quantitative reconciliation of covenant adjusted ebitda to net loss, which the company believes is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap. three months endeddecember 31, 2019($ in millions) twelve months endeddecember 31, 2019($ in millions) low range high range low range high range net loss $ (95 ) $ (80 ) $ (402 ) $ (387 ) interest expense, net 66 64 261 259 other (income) expense, net 3 (2 ) (6 ) 11 income tax expense 4 1 3  depreciation and amortization (1) 27 25 107 105 amortization of capitalized contract costs 115 113 438 436 non-capitalized contract costs (2) 66 60 276 270 non-cash compensation (3) 3  6 3 other adjustments (4) 5 20 44 59 adjustment for a change in accounting principle (topic 606) (5) (36 ) (28 ) (95 ) (87 ) covenant adjusted ebitda $ 158 $ 173 $ 632 $ 647 (1) excludes loan amortization costs that are included in interest expense.

domestication proposal: to approve by special resolution the change of mosaic acquisition corp.’s jurisdiction of incorporation by deregistering as an exempted company in the cayman islands and

act”), the shares of common stock of the company, as the successor to the cayman company are deemed to be registered under section 12(b) of the exchange act. in the domestication, each of the cayman company’s outstanding class a ordinary shares and class f ordinary shares has become, by operation of law, one share of the company’s class a common stock or class f common stock, respectively. consequently, each holder of a cayman company unit, class a ordinary share, class f ordinary share or warrant immediately prior to the domestication now holds a unit, share of class a common stock, share of class f common stock or warrant representing the same proportional equity interest in the company as that shareholder held in the cayman company and representing the same class of security. it is not necessary for stockholders to exchange their existing cayman company share certificates for new stock certificates of the company. until surrendered and exchanged, each certificate evidencing cayman company ordinary shares will be deemed for all purposes of the company to evidence the identical number of shares of the company’s common stock. holders of uncertificated shares of the cayman company immediately prior to the domestication continued as holders of uncertificated common stock of the company upon effectiveness of the domestication. the business, assets and liabilities of the company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, as well as its principal locations and fiscal year, were the same immediately after the domestication as they were immediately prior to the domestication. in addition, the directors and executive officers of the company immediately after the domestication were the same individuals who were directors and executive officers, respectively, of the cayman company immediately prior to the domestication. if you are a u.s. holder of the company’s units, class a common stock, class f common stock or warrants, you may be subject to u.s. federal income tax as a result of the domestication unless you make a timely election on your filing with the internal revenue service. in addition, if you are a non-u.s. holder of the company’s units, class a common stock, class f common stock or warrants, you may become subject to withholding tax on any dividends paid on such common stock subsequent to the effectiveness of the domestication, unless you are eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and you provide proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate. holders of the company’s units, class a common stock, class f common stock and warrants are urged to review the section of the final proxy statement/prospectus entitled “material tax considerations of
