vertically integrated zero emissions transportation systems provider that designs and manufactures state of the art battery electric and hydrogen electric vehicles, electric vehicle drivetrains, energy storage systems, and hydrogen fueling stations. to date, the company has been primarily focused on delivering zero emission class 8 semi-trucks to the commercial transportation sector in the u.s. and in europe. the company’s core product offering includes battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks and hydrogen fuel. the company operates in three business units: truck, energy and powersports. the truck business unit is developing and commercializing battery-electric vehicle (“bev”) and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (“fcev”) class 8 trucks that provide environmentally friendly, cost-effective solutions to the short haul and long-haul trucking sector. the energy business unit is developing and constructing a network of hydrogen fueling stations to meet hydrogen fuel demand for fcev customers. the powersports business unit is developing electric vehicle solutions for military and outdoor recreational applications. in 2019, legacy nikola partnered with iveco s.p.a (“iveco”), a subsidiary of cnh industrial n.v. (“cnhi”), a leading european industrial vehicle manufacturing company. together, the company and iveco are jointly developing cab over bev and fcev trucks for sale in the european market, which will be manufactured through a 50/50 owned joint venture in europe. in april 2020, legacy nikola and iveco entered into a series of agreements which established the joint venture, nikola iveco europe b.v. the joint venture with iveco provides the company with the manufacturing infrastructure to build bev trucks for the north american market prior to the completion of the company’s planned greenfield manufacturing facility in coolidge, arizona. the operations of the joint venture are expected to commence in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. the company plans to begin construction on its greenfield manufacturing facility in late 2020, and iveco will contribute technical engineering and production support. phase 1 of the greenfield manufacturing facility will be completed by the end of 2021, and the company expects to start bev production at the facility in 2022 and fcev production in 2023. 5 to date, legacy nikola has financed its operations primarily through private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock. from the date of its incorporation through march 31, 2020, legacy nikola has raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $435.1 million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, both for cash and in-kind contributions of services and intellectual property. legacy nikola incurred a net loss of $33.2 million and used $22.0 million in cash to fund its operations during the three months ended march 31, 2020. the company expects both its capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with its ongoing activities, as the company: ·constructs manufacturing facilities and purchases related equipment; ·commercializes its heavy-duty trucks and other products; ·develops hydrogen fueling stations; ·continues to invest in its technology; ·increases its investment in marketing and advertising, sales, and distribution infrastructure for the company’s products and services; ·maintains and improves its operational, financial and management information systems; ·hires additional personnel; ·obtains, maintains, expands, and protects its intellectual property portfolio; and ·operates as a public company. comparability of financial information the company’s results of operations and statements of assets and liabilities may not be comparable between periods as a result of the business combination. business combination and public company costs the disclosure set forth in the “introductory note” above with respect to the completion of the business combination is incorporated by reference into this item 2.01. following the closing, legacy nikola will be deemed the accounting predecessor of the merger and the company will be the successor registrant for sec purposes, meaning that legacy nikola’s financial statements for previous periods will be disclosed in the company’s future periodic reports filed with the sec. the merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. under this method of accounting, vectoiq will be treated as the acquired company for financial statement reporting purposes. the most significant change in the successor’s future reported financial position and results are an increase in cash and cash equivalents (as compared to legacy nikola’s consolidated balance sheet at march 31, 2020) of approximately $628 million through the date of this filing as a result of the merger and net proceeds from series d convertible preferred stock, offset by payments for operations. total non-recurring transaction costs are approximately $52.3 million, of which legacy nikola incurred approximately $6.6 million. in addition, stock options issued by legacy nikola’s chief executive officer to certain employees were accelerated upon the closing, which is a non-recurring expense of approximately $3.8 million for the three months ended june 30, 2020. the underlying legacy nikola common stock of these stock options are owned by legacy nikola’s chief executive officer and are considered to be issued by the company for accounting purposes. in addition, certain stock options vesting periods were accelerated due to the merger and legacy nikola recorded an additional $8.1 million of expense during the three months ended june 30, 2020. the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the company as of and for the three months ended march 31, 2020 is set forth in exhibit 99.2 hereto. as a consequence of the merger, legacy nikola is the successor to the company, an sec registered and nasdaq listed company, which will require legacy nikola to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. legacy nikola expects to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees. 6 key factors affecting operating results the company believes that its performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for the company but also pose risks and challenges, including those set forth in the proxy statement in the section entitled “risk factors” beginning on page 32 of the proxy statement. commercial launch of nikola heavy duty trucks and other products the company expects to derive revenue from its bev trucks in 2021 and fcev trucks in 2023. prior to commercialization, the company must complete modification or construction of required manufacturing facilities, purchase and integrate related equipment and software, and achieve several research and development milestones. as a result, the company will require substantial additional capital to develop its products and services and fund operations for the foreseeable future. until the company can generate sufficient revenue from product sales and hydrogen fcev leases, it expects to finance its operations through a combination of existing cash on hand as a result of the business combination and pipe, secondary public offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and licensing arrangements. the amount and timing of the company’s future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of the company’s development efforts. any delays in the successful completion of the company’s manufacturing facility will impact the company’s ability to generate revenue. customer demand while not yet commercially available, the company has received significant interest from potential customers. going forward, the company expects the size of its committed backlog to be an important indicator of its future performance. basis of presentation currently, the company conducts business through one operating segment. all long-lived assets are maintained in, and all losses are attributable to, the united states of america. a description of the company’s operating segment is included in the proxy statement in the section entitled “nikola management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— basis of presentation” on page 175 of the proxy statement. components of results of operations revenues to date, legacy nikola has primarily generated revenues from services related to solar installation projects that are completed in one year or less. solar installation projects are expected to be discontinued. following the anticipated introduction of the company’s products to the market, the company expects the significant majority of its revenue to be derived from direct sales of bev trucks starting in 2021 and from the bundled leases of fcev trucks beginning in 2023. the company’s bundled lease offering is inclusive of the cost of the truck, hydrogen fuel and regularly scheduled maintenance. the company expects the bundled leases to qualify for the “sales type lease” accounting under gaap, with the sale of the truck recognized upon the transfer of the title, and hydrogen fuel and maintenance revenues recognized over time as they are being provided to the customer. 7 cost of revenues to date, legacy nikola’s cost of revenues has included materials, labor, and other direct costs related to solar installation

of its in-kind investment into the company, iveco is providing the company with $100.0 million in advisory services (based on pre negotiated hourly rates), including project coordination, drawings, documentation support, engineering support, vehicle integration, and product validation support. those services are expected to be consumed primarily in 2020 and 2021 and will be recorded as research

well as expenses for facilities, depreciation, amortization, travel, and marketing costs. personnel related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. the company expects its selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as the company scales headcount with the growth of its business, and as a result of operating as a public

grants, subsidies, and merchandising. income tax expense the company’s income tax provision consists of an estimate for u.s. federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in the tax law. due to cumulative losses, the company maintains a valuation allowance against its u.s. and state deferred tax assets. cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds during the three months ended march 31, 2020 and 2019 was not material. results of operations

revenues legacy nikola’s total revenue decreased by $66 thousand or 53.2% from $124 thousand during the three months ended march 31, 2019 to $58 thousand during the three months ended march 31, 2020. the decrease in revenue was related to a decrease in solar installation services. cost of revenues legacy nikola’s cost of revenues decreased by $19 thousand or 30.6% from $62 thousand during the three months ended march 31, 2019 to $43 thousand during the three months ended march 31, 2020, due to a decrease in related revenues. research and development legacy nikola’s research and development expenses increased by $0.7 million or 2.8% from $23.4 million during the three months ended march 31, 2019 to $24.1 million during the three months ended march 31, 2020. this increase was primarily from higher personnel costs driven by increased engineering headcount, and depreciation costs primarily driven by the depreciation of the new hq facility. this was primarily offset from lower spend on purchased components due to preparation for nikola world in 2019. selling, general, and administrative legacy nikola’s selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million or 22.7% from $6.5 million during the three months ended march 31, 2019 to $8.0 million during the three months ended march 31, 2020. the increase was primarily related to higher personnel expenses driven by growth in headcount and higher general corporate expenses, including depreciation of the company’s new headquarters in phoenix, arizona. this was partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs from nikola world in 2019. interest income, net legacy nikola’s interest income, net decreased by $0.2 million or 80.5%, from $0.3 million during the three months ended march 31, 2019 to $0.1 million during the three months ended march 31, 2020. the decrease is primarily due to increased interest expense from legacy nikola’s financing lease and a decrease in average cash and cash equivalents balance, offset by a higher interest rate earned on deposits. loss on forward contract liability legacy nikola’s loss on series d redeemable convertible preferred stock forward contract liability represents the recognized loss from a $1.3 million change in fair value as of march 31, 2020. other income, net legacy nikola’s other income, net increased by $0.1 million, from $1 thousand during the three months ended march 31, 2019 to $0.1 million during the three months ended march 31, 2020. the increase was primarily related to subcontracting work performed on government contracts. income tax expense legacy nikola’s income tax expense was immaterial for the three months ended march 31, 2020 and 2019. legacy nikola has accumulated net operating losses at the federal and state level and maintain a full valuation allowance against legacy nikola’s net deferred taxes. 10 non-gaap financial measures in addition to legacy nikola’s results determined in accordance with gaap, the company believes the following non-gaap measure is useful in evaluating its operational performance. the company uses the following non-gaap financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. the company believes that non-gaap financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ebitda and adjusted ebitda “ebitda” is defined as net loss before other non-operating expense or income, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. “adjusted ebitda” is defined as ebitda adjusted for stock-based compensation and other special items determined by management. adjusted ebitda is intended as a supplemental measure of its performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, gaap. the company believes that the use of ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the company’s financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non gaap financial measures to investors. however, you should be aware that when evaluating ebitda and adjusted ebitda the company may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. in addition, the company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that the company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. the company’s computation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate adjusted ebitda in the same fashion. because of these limitations, ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap. the company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the company’s gaap results and using ebitda and adjusted ebitda on a supplemental basis. you should review the reconciliation of net loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the company’s business. the following table reconciles net loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the three months ended march 31, 2020 and 2019: three months ended march 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) net loss $(33,163) $(30,097) interest income, net (64) (333) income tax expense 1 2 depreciation and amortization 1,351 196 ebitda (31,875) (30,232) stock-based compensation 1,313 1,153 loss on series a redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability — 593 loss on forward contract liability 1,324 — adjusted ebitda $(29,238) $(28,486) liquidity and capital resources since inception, legacy nikola has financed its operations primarily from the sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock. as of march 31, 2020, legacy nikola’s principal sources of liquidity were legacy nikola’s cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $75.5 million, which are primarily invested in money market funds. 11 short-term liquidity requirements as of the date of this current report on from 8-k, legacy nikola has yet to generate any material revenues from its business operations. as of march 31, 2020, legacy nikola’s current assets were $101.2 million consisting primarily of cash and restricted cash of $79.6 million, and legacy nikola’s current liabilities were $30.5 million primarily comprised of accrued expenses, accounts payables and a $4.1 million equipment term note. in connection with the june 3, 2020 business combination and pipe transactions the company raised gross proceeds of $763.2 million, incurring $52.3 million in transaction fees, for net proceeds of $710.9 million. net proceeds excludes payments for redemptions of m&m residual for $70.0 million and repurchase of nimbus series b convertible redeemable preferred shares for $25.0 million. as a result of these transactions, as of june 3, 2020 the company had a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $729.4 million. the company believes this will be sufficient to continue to execute its business strategy over the next twelve to eighteen month period by (i) completing the development and industrialization of the nikola tre bev truck, (ii) completing phase one construction of the greenfield manufacturing facility, (iii) completing the construction of a pilot commercial hydrogen station and (iv) hiring of personnel. however, actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors, including: ·the costs of building phase 1 of the company’s greenfield manufacturing facility and equipment; ·the timing and the costs involved in bringing the company’s vehicles to market, mainly the nikola tre bev truck; ·the company’s ability to manage the costs of manufacturing the nikola tre bev trucks; ·the scope, progress, results, costs, timing and outcomes of the company’s research and development for its fuel cell trucks; ·the costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting the company’s intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities; ·revenues received from sales of the nikola tre bev trucks in 2021; ·the costs of additional general and administrative personnel, including accounting and finance, legal and human resources, as a result of becoming a public company; ·the company’s ability to collect revenues; and ·other risks discussed in the proxy statement in the section entitled “risk factors” beginning on page 32 of the proxy statement. long-term liquidity requirements the capital raised in the business combination will not be sufficient to cover forecasted capital needs and operating expenditures in fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2024. until the company can generate sufficient revenue from bev truck sales and fcev leases to cover operating expenses, working capital and capital expenditures, the company expect to fund cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financing, including lease securitizations. if the company raises funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result. any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of common stock. if the company raises funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders common stock. the terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on the company’s operations. the credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. if adequate funds are not available, the company will need to curb its expansion plans or limit the company’s research and development activities, which would have a material adverse impact on the company’s business prospects and results of operations. 12 the following table provides a summary of cash flow data (in thousands): three months ended march 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) net cash used in operating activities $(22,047) $(32,162) net cash used in investing activities (1,439) (9,863) net cash provided by financing activities 13,301 — cash flows from operating activities legacy nikola’s cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by the growth of legacy nikola’s business primarily related to research and development and selling, general, and administrative activities. legacy nikola’s operating cash flows are also affected by legacy nikola’s working capital needs to support growth in personnel related expenditures and fluctuations in accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. legacy nikola’s net cash used in operating activities was $22.0 million for the three months ended march 31, 2020. the most significant component of legacy nikola’s cash used during this period was a net loss of $33.2 million, which included non-cash expenses of $6.7 million for in-kind services, $1.4 million related to depreciation and amortization, $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, and a loss of $1.3 million related to the change in fair value of legacy nikola’s series d redeemable convertible preferred stock forward contract liability, and net cash inflows of $0.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. legacy nikola’s cash used in operating activities was $32.2 million for the three months ended march 31, 2019. the largest component of legacy nikola’s cash used during this period was a net loss of $30.1 million, which included non-cash charges of $1.2 million related to stock based compensation, loss of $0.6 million related to the change in fair value of legacy nikola’s series a redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, and $0.2 million related to depreciation and amortization expense, and net cash outflows of $4.0 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable cash flows from investing activities legacy nikola continues to experience negative cash flows from investing activities as it expands legacy nikola’s business and builds its infrastructure. cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support the company’s growth. legacy nikola net cash used in investing activities is expected to continue to increase substantially as the company builds out and tools the north american truck manufacturing facility in coolidge, arizona and develop the network of hydrogen fueling stations. legacy nikola net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million for the three months ended march 31, 2020, which was due to purchases and deposits on capital equipment for research and development testing equipment and software purchases. legacy nikola net cash used in investing activities was $9.9 million for the three months ended march 31, 2019, which was primarily due to purchases and deposits on capital equipment of $5.8 million and $4.0 million related to the construction of the company’s headquarters. cash flows from financing activities through march 31, 2020, legacy nikola raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $435.1 million, of which $355.1 million was in the form of cash, from sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock. additionally, in april 2020, legacy nikola received cash of $50.0 million in connection with the issuance of its series d redeemable convertible preferred stock. 13 legacy nikola’s net cash provided by financing activities was $13.3 million for the three months ended march 31, 2020, which was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of series d redeemable convertible preferred stock of $13.0 million and proceeds from tenant allowances for the construction of the company’s headquarters of $0.9 million, offset by payments made for future stock issuance costs of $0.4 million and legacy nikola’s financing lease of $0.2 million. legacy nikola has no cash financing activities for the three months ended march 31, 2019. contractual obligations and commitments for the three months ended march 31, 2020, there have been no material changes to legacy nikola’s significant contractual obligations as previously disclosed in the proxy statement. waitlist and reservations potential fcev customers may reserve slots in the company’s future production schedule by submitting a reservation request on company’s website. no deposit is required to be paid by the customer. the company stopped soliciting fcev reservations in fiscal 2019 in order to focus on large corporate dedicated customers. the company considers the reservation list as an indication of potential demand rather than a product backlog for pending vehicle sales, as customers have not made firm commitments to order and take deliveries of vehicles and may cancel such reservations at any time. as the company nears commercial production in 2023, the company expects to convert existing fcev reservations into binding orders. as of march 31, 2020, legacy nikola had approximately 14,000 reservations for its fcev trucks. the company only accepts binding orders on its bev trucks, which are negotiated on a case by case basis. off balance sheet arrangements since the date of legacy nikola’s incorporation, legacy nikola has not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the sec. critical accounting policies and estimates the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. these principles require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. the company’s most significant estimates and judgments involve valuation of the company’s stock-based compensation, including the fair value of common stock, the valuation of warrant liabilities, the valuation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liability and estimates related to the company’s build-to-suit lease. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from those estimates. there have been no substantial changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them during the three months ended march 30, 2020. a full discussion of these estimates and policies is included in the proxy statement in the section entitled “nikola’s management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 173 of the proxy statement, which is incorporated herein by reference. emerging growth company status the company is an emerging growth company (“egc”), as defined in the

director compensation the board designed the company’s non-employee director compensation program to reward directors for their contributions to the company’s success, align the director compensation program with stockholder interests and the company’s executive compensation program, and provide competitive compensation necessary to attract and retain high quality non-employee directors. the board expects to review director compensation periodically to ensure that director compensation remains competitive such that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified directors. under the

are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the united states private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “seem,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the company’s and nikola’s ability to consummate the proposed transactions; the expected timing of completion of the proposed transactions and the timing of the expected commencement of the trading of the combined company’s common stock and warrants on the nasdaq global select market. these statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of nikola’s and the company’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of nikola and the company. these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, financial, legal, political and business conditions and changes in domestic and foreign markets; the potential effects of covid-19; the potential effects of domestic civil unrest and the potential closure of government offices, the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the proposed transactions or to satisfy the other conditions to the closing of the proposed transactions, and those factors discussed in the proxy statement under the heading “risk factors,” and other documents of the company filed, or to be filed, with the sec. if the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither nikola nor the company presently do not know or that nikola and the company currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect nikola’s and the company’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this current report on form 8-k. nikola and the company anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause their assessments to change. however, while nikola and the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, nikola and the company specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing nikola’s or the company’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this current report on form 8-k. accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. item 8.01. other events. the disclosure set forth above in item 7.01 of this current report on form 8-k is incorporated by reference herein. 6 signature pursuant to the requirements of the
