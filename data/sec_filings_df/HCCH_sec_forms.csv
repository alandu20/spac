hl acquisitions corp., a british virgin islands business company (“hl”) entered into a business combination agreement (“agreement”) with fusion welcome – fuel, s.a., a public limited company domiciled in portugal, sociedade anónima (the “company”), dolya holdco 3 limited, private limited company domiciled in ireland (“parent”), fusion fuel atlantic limited, a british virgin islands business company and wholly owned subsidiary of parent (“merger sub”), and the shareholders of the company (“company shareholders”). pursuant to the agreement, (i) merger sub will merge with and into hl (the “merger”) with hl being the surviving entity of the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent, followed immediately by (ii) the acquisition by parent of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the company (the “share exchange”, and together with the merger, the “transactions”). the company focuses on “green” hydrogen production through the use of concentrated photovoltaic systems. the company’s two principal lines of business include the sale, installation, operation, and maintenance of “green” hydrogen generators for clients and the development of “green” hydrogen plants with a view toward the sale of “green” hydrogen at pre-determined prices through purchase agreements. the transactions are expected to be consummated in the third quarter of 2020, following receipt of the required approval by the hl shareholders and the fulfillment of other conditions. the following summary of the agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the agreement. the agreement is attached as an exhibit hereto and incorporated herein by reference. general consideration upon consummation of the merger, (i) each hl ordinary share outstanding on the closing date will be converted into one class a ordinary share of parent (“class a ordinary shares”), except that holders of hl ordinary shares sold in hl’s initial public offering will be entitled to elect instead to receive a pro rata portion of hl’s trust account, as provided in hl’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, (ii) each outstanding right of hl will be exchanged for one-tenth of one ordinary share of hl immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and each such ordinary share of hl will be converted into one class a ordinary share, and (iii) each outstanding warrant of hl will remain outstanding and will entitle the holder to purchase one class a ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share (“hl parent warrant”). upon consummation of the share exchange, the company shareholders will receive their pro rata portion of an aggregate of 2,125,000 class b ordinary shares of parent (“class b ordinary shares”) and warrants (“parent warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 2,125,000 class a ordinary shares. the class a ordinary shares and class b ordinary shares will be identical, except that holders of class b ordinary shares will have certain protective rights, including the right to approve any liquidation, sale of substantially all assets or equity, merger, consolidation, or similar transaction of parent, amendments to parent’s memorandum and articles of association, the creation or issuance of any new class or series of capital stock or equity securities convertible into capital stock of parent, changes to the size of parent’s or the company’s board of directors, and the removal of any member of the company’s board of directors. each class b ordinary share is convertible at any time into one class a ordinary share at the option of the holder and all outstanding class b ordinary shares will automatically convert into an equal number of class a ordinary shares on december 31, 2023. the parent warrants are identical to the hl parent warrants, except that they will not be redeemable by parent and may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis at the holder’s option as long as the parent warrants are held by company shareholders or their affiliates or permitted transferees. 1 the company shareholders also will have the right to receive their pro rata portion of up to an aggregate of 1,137,000 class a ordinary shares and parent warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,137,000 class a ordinary shares upon the signing of agreements for the production and supply by the company or its affiliates of green hydrogen to certain purchasers (or, in the case of the first of such agreements, certain milestones with respect to performance under the agreement) prior to june 30, 2022. the total number of shares earnable for each such production agreement will be equal to twenty percent of the net present value of the agreement divided by €10.73, representing the aggregate agreed value of one parent class a ordinary share and one parent warrant. the company shareholders have agreed not to transfer the class b ordinary shares or parent warrants issued in the share exchange (or the class a ordinary shares issuable upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, thereof) except to certain permitted transferees, until one year after the consummation of the transactions, or earlier upon the subsequent completion of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, or similar transaction. webber research and advisory provided to the hl board of directors its preliminary valuation of the business of the company and its preliminary conclusion that the company has a market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in hl’s trust account. webber research and advisory will provide its final valuation prior to closing. sponsor agreement hl acquisitions holdings llc, metropolitan capital partners v, llc, the jeffrey schwarz children’s trust, and, in the discretion of hl, any other persons holding ordinary shares or warrants of hl (the “sponsors”) have agreed to enter into an agreement with parent to forfeit 125,000 ordinary shares and 125,000 warrants of hl upon the consummation of the transactions.

by the company shareholders and hl for breaches of their respective representations, warranties and covenants. claims for indemnification may be asserted once damages exceed a €750,000 threshold and will be reimbursable for damages in excess of such threshold. claims for indemnification must be brought before the tenth business day after parent files its annual report for the fiscal year ending december 31, 2021. 2 to provide a source of funds for the company shareholders’ indemnification of hl, 212,500 class b ordinary shares to be issued by parent in the share exchange (the “escrow shares”) will be deposited into escrow with continental stock transfer & trust company acting as escrow agent. to provide a source of funds for hl’s indemnification of the company, parent will reserve for issuance an additional 212,500 class a ordinary shares (the “indemnification pool”). other than with respect to actual fraud, each of hl’s and the company’s right to indemnification will be its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for money damages arising out of or relating to the agreement. the escrow shares will provide the sole source of funds for hl’s indemnification right and the indemnification pool will provide the sole source of funds for the company’s indemnification right. registration rights agreement prior to the closing, parent will enter into an agreement (“registration rights agreement”) with the company shareholders pursuant to which the company shareholders will be granted certain rights to have registered, in certain circumstances, the resale under

directors of hl. pursuant to the agreement, seller will sell to hl all of the outstanding equity interests of chi in exchange for ordinary shares and warrants of hl (the “business combination”). chi,

(“class ii warrants”). hl has received the opinion of rmk maritime capital, llc that (i) the aggregate merger consideration to be issued by the company in the business combination pursuant to the agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the company and (ii) chi has a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in hl’s trust account. additionally, hl acquisitions holdings llc and metropolitan capital partners v, llc (the “founders”) will enter into an agreement (“founder agreement”) to forfeit 200,000 ordinary shares of hl in exchange for the issuance of class i warrants to purchase 600,000 ordinary shares of hl. the founders will also agree to forfeit up to an aggregate of up to 579,364 ordinary shares of hl, with the number of shares to be forfeited to be determined based on the amount of cash remaining in hl’s trust account after deducting all amounts to be paid to hl’s shareholders exercising their conversion rights and after adding all amounts raised by or on behalf of hl in private financings (with half of the shares forfeited by the founders to be cancelled and the other half of such shares to be transferred to the seller). cancellation

the closing date, rather than being exercisable to purchase one ordinary share of hl (the “warrant amendment”). hl has agreed to call a meeting of the holders of outstanding warrants in connection with the transaction and recommend that such warrant holders vote in favor of the warrant amendment, which is a condition to the closing. 1 indemnification the agreement provides for mutual

right to indemnification will be its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for money damages arising out of or relating to the agreement. the escrow shares will provide the sole source of
