give rise to or result in any business combination (as defined in the merger agreement) other than with velodyne, its shareholders and their affiliates or representatives. graf change in recommendation graf is required to use its reasonable best efforts to include in the proxy statement the recommendation of graf’s board of directors to graf’s stockholders that they approve the transaction proposals (the “graf board recommendation”). graf is permitted to change the graf board recommendation (such change, a “change in recommendation”) if it determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such a change in recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. conditions to closing

as of a specified date, are modified or qualified by information in one or more confidential disclosure letters prepared in connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties. accordingly, the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are not necessarily characterizations of the actual state of facts about graf, velodyne or the other parties thereto at the time they were made or otherwise and should only be read in conjunction with the other information that graf makes publicly available in reports, statements and other documents filed with the sec. support

agreement, regardless of whether the merger is no longer recommended by the velodyne board of directors in accordance with the merger agreement. the shares of velodyne common stock that are owned by mr. hall or with respect to which mr. hall has the right to vote by proxy, all of which are subject to the support agreement, represent a majority of the outstanding voting power of velodyne. in

connection with the execution of the merger agreement, graf acquisition llc (“sponsor”) entered into a sponsor agreement (the “sponsor agreement”) with graf and velodyne, pursuant to which, among other things, the sponsor agreed to vote all founder shares (as defined in the sponsor agreement) beneficially owned by the sponsor in favor of each of the proposals at the graf special stockholder meeting to be presented for graf stockholder approval. the sponsor agreement amends and restates, with respect to the sponsor, the sponsor’s existing letter agreement, dated october 15, 2018 (the “existing sponsor agreement”), but will automatically revert to the existing sponsor agreement if the merger agreement is validly terminated. pursuant to the sponsor agreement, the sponsor will forfeit 3,519,128 founder shares and all of the private placement warrants (as defined in the sponsor agreement), in each case for no consideration, immediately prior to (but conditioned and effective upon) completion of the merger. following completion of the merger, the sponsor will retain 2,507,000 founder shares, 275,000 of which shall be earnout founder shares (as defined in the sponsor agreement). the sponsor agreement also provides that all earnout founder shares shall be subject to the performance vesting condition described below. the sponsor has agreed not to transfer any unvested earnout founder shares prior to the date such securities become vested. pursuant to the sponsor agreement, 100% of the earnout founder shares shall vest at such time as a $15.00 stock price level (as defined below) is achieved on or before the date that is six (6) months after the date of the merger. any earnout founder shares that do not vest on or prior to such date shall be forfeited. the sponsor agreement provides that the sponsor will not redeem any founder shares in connection with the merger. the sponsor has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer any founder shares or any private placement warrants (as defined in the sponsor agreement) (or any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) until the earlier of (a) one year after the completion of the merger and (b) subsequent to the merger, either (i) the achievement of a $12.00 stock price level (provided that the applicable thirty (30) day trading day period commences at least 150 days after the merger) or (ii) the date on which graf completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or similar transaction that results in all of graf’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property (the “lock-up period”). the applicable “stock price level” will be considered achieved only when the closing price of common stock on the new york stock exchange is greater than or equal to the applicable threshold for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period. the stock price levels will be equitably adjusted for any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event affecting the common stock after the date of the merger agreement. the sponsor agreement shall terminate on the expiration of the lock-up period; provided, however, that if the merger agreement is validly terminated, the sponsor agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no force and effect and, with respect to the sponsor, shall revert to the existing sponsor agreement. subscription agreements in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, the company entered into subscription agreements (the “subscription agreements”), each dated as of july 2, 2020, with certain institutional investors,

sponsor owns approximately 34.3% of the outstanding shares of common stock and certain members of the company's management are members of the sponsor. the obligations to consummate the subscriptions are conditioned upon, among other things, there being at least $50,000,000 remaining in the company's trust account on the closing date after taking into account redemptions by the company's public stockholders (if any) and certain customary closing conditions and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. item 3.02 unregistered sales of equity securities. the

combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ

limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the company and velodyne following the announcement of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of the company or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) the receipt of an unsolicited offer from another party for an alternative business transaction that could interfere with the business combination; (5) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the shares of common stock of the post-acquisition company on the new york stock exchange following the business combination; (6) the risk that the announcement and consummation of the business combination disrupts current plans and operations; (7) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (8) costs related to the business combination; (9) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (10) the possibility that velodyne or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (11) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and in the company’s other filings with the sec, including the company’s annual report. the company cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. the company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k shall not constitute a solicitation of a proxy, consent
