competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (8) costs related to the business combination; (9) changes in applicable laws or

statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forum and ittella parent’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, forum’s and ittella parent’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside forum’s and ittella parent’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against forum or ittella parent following the announcement of the merger agreement and the business combination; (3) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of forum or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) the receipt of an unsolicited offer from another party for an alternative business transaction that could interfere with the business combination; (5) the inability to obtain the listing of the ordinary shares of the post-acquisition company on the nasdaq stock market or any alternative national securities exchange following the business combination; (6) the risk that the announcement and consummation of the business combination disrupts current plans and operations; (7) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (8) costs related to the business combination; (9) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (10) the possibility that ittella parent may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (11) the impact of covid-19 on the combined company’s business; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement to be filed relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and in forum’s other filings with the sec. some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by the covid-19 outbreak and there may be additional risks that forum considers immaterial or which are unknown. forum cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. forum cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. forum does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k shall not constitute a solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the business combination. this current report on form 8-k
