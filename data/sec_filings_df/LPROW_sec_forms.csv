special meeting of nebula stockholders held on june 9, 2020, nebula stockholders considered and approved the 2020 stock option and incentive plan (the 2020 plan). the company has initially reserved 9,693,750 shares of company common stock outstanding upon the closing for the issuance of awards under the 2020 plan. the 2020 plan provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase each january 1, beginning on january 1, 2021, by 4.0% of the outstanding number of shares of company common stock on the immediately preceding december 31 (the annual increase). this limit is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in the capitalization of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries 4 after giving effect to the business combination (the combined company). the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of incentive stock options under the 2020 plan shall not exceed the initial limit cumulatively increased on january 1, 2021 and on each january 1 thereafter by the lesser of the annual increase or 14,540,625 shares of stock. based upon a price per share of $10.00, the maximum aggregate market value of the common stock that could potentially be issued under the 2020 plan is $96,937,500. . the 2020 plan contains a limitation whereby the value of all awards under the 2020 plan and all other cash compensation paid by the combined company to any non-employee director for services as a non-employee director may not exceed $750,000 in any calendar year. the 2020 plan will be administered by the combined companys compensation committee, the board or such other similar committee pursuant to the terms of the 2020 plan. the administrator, which initially will be the compensation committee, will have full power to select, from among the individuals eligible for awards, the individuals to whom awards will be granted, to make any combination of awards to participants, and to determine the specific terms and conditions of each award, subject to the provisions of the 2020 plan. the administrator may delegate to the chief executive officer the authority to grant stock options and other awards to employees who are not subject to the reporting and other provisions of section 16 of the exchange act, subject to certain limitations and guidelines. persons eligible to participate in the 2020 plan will be those full or part-time officers, employees, non-employee directors and other key persons (including consultants) as selected from time to time by the administrator in its discretion. approximately 97 individuals are currently eligible to participate in the 2020 plan, which includes approximately six officers, 83 employees who are not officers, seven non-employee directors, and one consultant. the 2020 plan permits the granting of both options to purchase common stock intended to qualify as incentive stock options under section 422 of the code and options that do not so qualify. options granted under the 2020 plan will be non-qualified options if they fail to qualify as incentive options or exceed the annual limit on incentive stock options. incentive stock options may only be granted to employees of the company and its subsidiaries. non-qualified options may be granted to any persons eligible to receive incentive options and to non-employee directors and key persons. the option exercise price of each option will be determined by the administrator but may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant unless the option is granted (i) pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, section 424(a) of the code or (ii) to individuals who are not subject to u.s. income tax. the term of each option will be fixed by our administrator and may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. the administrator will determine at what time or times each option may be exercised, including the ability to accelerate the vesting of such options. upon exercise of options, the option exercise price must be paid in full either in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the compensation committee or by delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares of common stock that are beneficially owned by the optionee for at least six months or were purchased in the open market. subject to applicable law, the exercise price may also be delivered by a broker pursuant to irrevocable instructions to the broker from the optionee. in addition, the compensation committee may permit non-qualified options to be exercised using a net exercise feature which reduces the number of shares issued to the optionee by the number of shares with fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price. the combined companys compensation committee may award stock appreciation rights subject to such conditions and restrictions as it may determine. stock appreciation rights entitle the recipient to shares of common stock, or cash, equal to the value of the appreciation in our stock price over the exercise price. the exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. the term of each stock appreciation right will be fixed by the administrator and may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. the administrator will determine at what time or times each stock appreciation right may be exercised. the administrator may award restricted shares of common stock and restricted stock units to participants subject to such conditions and restrictions as it may determine. these conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals and/or continued employment with us through a specified vesting period. the administrator may also grant shares of common stock that are free from any restrictions under the 2020 plan. unrestricted stock may be granted to participants in recognition of past services or for other valid consideration and may be issued in lieu of cash compensation due to such participant. the administrator may grant dividend equivalent rights to participants that entitle the recipient to receive credits for dividends that would be paid if the recipient had held a specified number of shares of common stock. 5 the administrator may grant cash bonuses under the 2020 plan to participants, subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. the 2020 plan provides that upon the effectiveness of a sale event, as defined in the 2020 plan, an acquirer or successor entity may assume, continue or substitute outstanding awards under the 2020 plan. to the extent that awards granted under the 2020 plan are not assumed or continued or substituted by the successor entity, upon the effective time of the sale event, such awards under the 2020 plan shall terminate. in such case, except as may be otherwise provided in the relevant award agreement, all options and stock appreciation rights with time-based vesting, conditions of restrictions that are not exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the sale event will become fully exercisable as of the effective time of the sale event, all other awards with time-based vesting, conditions or restrictions, will become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the effective time of the sale event and all awards with conditions and restrictions relating to the attainment of performance goals may become vested and nonforfeitable in the discretion of the administrator. in the event of such termination, individuals holding options and stock appreciation rights will be permitted to exercise such options and stock appreciation rights (to the extent exercisable) within a specified period of time prior to the sale event. in addition, in connection with the termination of the 2020 plan upon a sale event, we may make or provide for a cash payment to participants holding vested and exercisable options and stock appreciation rights equal to the difference between the per share cash consideration payable to stockholders in the sale event and the exercise price of the options or stock appreciation rights and we may make or provide for a cash payment to participants holding other vested awards. participants in the 2020 plan are responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes that the combined company is required by law to withhold upon the exercise of options or stock appreciation rights or vesting of other awards. subject to approval by the compensation committee, participants may elect to have the minimum tax withholding obligations satisfied by authorizing the combined company to withhold shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to the exercise or vesting of such award. the administrator may amend or discontinue the 2020 plan and the administrator may amend or cancel outstanding awards for purposes of satisfying changes in law or any other lawful purpose, but no such action may adversely affect rights under an award without the holders consent. certain amendments to the 2020 plan require the approval of the combined companys stockholders. no awards may be granted under the 2020 plan after the date that is ten years from the date of stockholder approval of the 2020 plan. no awards under the 2020 plan have been made prior to the date hereof. a more complete summary of the terms of the 2020 plan is set forth in the proxy statement and prospectus included in the companys registration statement on form s-4 (file no. 333- 237264) in the section titled nebula stockholder proposal no. 4the 2020 plan proposal.
