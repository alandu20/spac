dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 pertaining to compensation committee independence and the role and disclosure of compensation consultants and other advisers to the

(the “company” or “boxwood”) and atlas intermediate holdings llc (“atlas”), the company entered into a debt commitment letter (the “debt commitment letter”) with macquarie capital (usa) inc. (“macquarie capital”), macquarie capital funding llc (“macquarie funding”) and natixis, new york branch (collectively with macquarie capital and macquarie funding, the “commitment parties”), pursuant to which the commitment parties agreed to provide (or to have certain of their affiliates provide), subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the closing of the business combination, credit facilities (the “credit facilities”) for the purpose of financing (i) a portion of the consideration payable under the unit purchase agreement relating to the business combination (as amended and as the same may be further amended from time to time, the “purchase agreement”), (ii) costs and expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the business combination, (iii) the repayment of the existing indebtedness of atlas intermediate holdings llc, a delaware limited liability company (“atlas intermediate”), and (iv) general corporate expenditures. in connection with the arrangement of the credit facilities, atlas will be providing to potential lenders the following preliminary, unaudited financial results of atlas for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019. for the year ended december 31, 2019, atlas’: ·total gross revenues are estimated to be $475.2 million; ·revenue net of reimbursable expenses is estimated to be $377.8 million (which reimbursable expenses include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs); ·net income is estimated to be $9.3 million; ·covenant adjusted ebitda* is estimated to be $72.9 million; and ·backlog is estimated to be $601.1 million (or $615.1 million after taking into account the backlog of long engineering, inc. (“long engineering”)). the selected preliminary financial data in this current report on form 8-k has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, the management of atlas. the information and estimates have not been compiled or examined by atlas’ independent auditors and are subject to revision as atlas prepares its financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2019. because atlas has not completed its normal closing and review procedures for the year ended december 31, 2019, and subsequent events may occur that require adjustments to these results, there can be no assurance that the final results for the year ended december 31, 2019 will not differ materially from these estimates. these estimates should not be viewed as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (“gaap”) or as a measure of performance. in addition, these estimated results for the year ended december 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for any future period. the information in this current report on form 8-k is being furnished pursuant to item 7.01 of form 8-k and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of section 18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the “exchange act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing made by the company under the securities act of 1933 or the exchange act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. 1 forward-looking statements this current report includes certain statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws. forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. forward-looking statements may include, for example, statements about certain preliminary, unaudited financial results for atlas’ year ended december 31, 2019, which are subject to finalization and contingencies associated with atlas’ financial and accounting procedures, the parties’ ability to effect the business combination and related financing transactions and the benefits of the business combination. these forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this current report, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the parties’ views as of any subsequent date, and boxwood and atlas do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. as a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. some factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the unit purchase agreement entered into in connection with the business combination (the “transaction agreement”); (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against boxwood or atlas relating to the proposed business combination and related transactions or the definitive proxy statement, as supplemented; (3) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of boxwood or satisfy other conditions to the closing of the business combination and the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the agreement between atlas and long engineering due to the failure to satisfy the conditions to the closing of such transactions; (4) the ability to obtain or maintain the listing of boxwood’s shares of class a common stock and warrants on nasdaq following the business combination; (5) the risk that the business combination disrupts the parties’ current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions described herein; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination or the acquisition of long engineering, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of boxwood, atlas and long engineering to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain management and key employees; (7) costs related to the business combination and the acquisition of long engineering; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the possibility that boxwood, atlas or long engineering may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (10) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the definitive proxy statement, as supplemented, filed by boxwood with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the “sec”) in connection with the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and other factors identified in boxwood’s prior and future filings with the sec, available at www.sec.gov. *non-gaap financial measures covenant adjusted ebitda is a financial measure not prepared in accordance with gaap. atlas believes that the presentation of covenant adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants under the agreements governing atlas’ existing indebtedness and the credit facilities. atlas and the company caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with atlas’ definition of covenant adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate covenant adjusted ebitda in the same manner. atlas defines covenant adjusted ebitda as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjustments for certain one time or nonrecurring items and other adjustments permitted in certain covenant calculations under the agreements governing atlas’ existing indebtedness and the credit facilities. covenant adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of atlas’ financial performance, is defined and calculate differently than the adjusted ebitda performance measure disclosed in “atlas’ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—non-gaap financial measures” in the company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the sec on november 12, 2019 and is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for, or in isolation from, net income (loss), revenue, operating profit, cash flow from operating activities or any other operating performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap. atlas excludes these items from net income in arriving at covenant adjusted ebitda because these amounts are either nonrecurring or can vary substantially within the industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. certain items excluded from covenant adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in covenant adjusted ebitda. atlas’ presentation of covenant adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an indication that results will be unaffected by the items excluded from covenant adjusted ebitda. atlas is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of covenant adjusted ebitda to cash flow from operating activities as the items necessary to provide such reconciliation are not yet available. 2 see the following table for a quantitative reconciliation of covenant adjusted ebitda to net income. fiscal year ended december 31, ($ in thousands) 2019 net income $9,346 interest expense 10,842 provision for income taxes 2,927 depreciation and amortization 21,701 ebitda $44,816 non-recurring expenses one-time legal fees and transaction professional costs(1) $14,565 non-cash equity compensation(2) 2,041 startup expenses for new divisions(3) 1,417 costs to implement synergies and severance costs(4) 1,532 previous owner expenses(5) 760 shutdown of telecom division(6) 226 discontinued business lines(7) 213 total non-recurring expenses 20,753 pro forma cost synergies(8) 6,236 public company costs(9) (2,500) acquisition of long engineering(10) 3,600 covenant adjusted ebitda $72,905 ____________ (1)includes non-recurring professional fees for legal, accounting, investment banking and consulting services incurred in connection with the review and consummation of atlas’ acquisitions in 2018, the merger with atc group partners llc (“atc”) in 2019 and the business combination with boxwood in 2019. (2)represents non-cash equity-based compensation to atlas employees which will not continue after the consummation of the business combination. (3)includes startup expenses incurred in late 2018 and early 2019 in connection with the opening of three new offices and the hiring of related new personnel as part of a one-time major internal expansion and represents the amount of such expenses in each period required to bring each such office to break-even. as atlas’ operational strategy has historically focused on external growth and accretive acquisitions rather than internal expansions of this type, these office openings were undertaken due to specific anticipated contracted revenue for 2019 and represent atypical startup expenses within atlas’ operational strategy which are not indicative of atlas’ ongoing and expected future operating performance. the aforementioned contracted revenue caused such offices to report profit in mid-2019. (4)reflects one-time severance, office lease termination and other costs to implement the cost savings synergies in connection with the merger with atc. (5)represents non-recurring expenses incurred by atlas related to former owners of certain of atlas’ subsidiaries, including litigation involving atlas and one such former owner that resulted in significant legal fees and arbitration expenses, the write-off of loans owed to atlas by a former owner, the payout of deferred compensation to former owners and other non-recurring payments to former owners. (6)represents one-time costs incurred in connection with the closing of atlas’ telecom division in 2019. (7)reflects losses related to business lines sold off in 2018 and 2019 (power & industrials, new england construction and industrial waste). (8)pro forma cost reductions implemented in connection with the merger with atc, including headcount reduction, facility closures, sourcing and information technology. (9)pro forma incremental costs to be incurred in connection with atlas becoming a public company. (10)pro forma impact of the acquisition of long engineering. 3 signature pursuant to the requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. boxwood merger corp. by: /s/ stephen m. kadenacy name: stephen m. kadenacy title: chief executive officer dated: february 12, 2020 4 ",8-K,2020-02-12 10:21:58

committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, on the closing date, to purchase (i) up to 145,000 units of a new class of series a senior preferred units of holdings (the “preferred units”) at a price per preferred unit of $1,000.00, resulting in gross proceeds to holdings of up to $145.0 million (the “preferred commitment”) and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of class a common stock of boxwood, par value $0.001 per share (the “class a common stock”), at a price per share of $10.00, resulting in gross proceeds of $10.0 million to holdings (both such commitments, the “commitment”). holdings may elect to reduce the number of preferred units to be sold to gso if the amount of funds remaining in boxwood’s trust account established in connection with its initial public offering (the “trust account”) following any redemptions of class a common stock by boxwood’s public stockholders in connection with the vote to approve the business combination (any such redemptions, the “redemptions”) plus the amount of any additional equity investments, outside of the preferred commitment, that boxwood may secure prior to the closing (the “common equity contribution”) is sufficient to reduce the value of the holding units to be received by the sellers to $120.0 million and still have greater than $10.0 million available. for more information on the mix of cash and equity to be received by the sellers, see the sections entitled “purchase agreement amendment” and “amendment to the debt commitment letter” below. if, due to any such reduction, gso is offered fewer than 145,000 preferred units, it will not be obligated to purchase any shares of class a common stock. however, holdings may not reduce the number of preferred units to be sold to gso to fewer than 130,000. 1 the commitment letter permits holdings to offer preferred units to third party investors (other than bernhard capital partners management lp (“bcp”) or entities affiliated

obligation of gso to fund the commitment will terminate automatically and immediately upon the earliest to occur of (a) the termination of the purchase agreement, (b) the closing of the business combination without the use of the commitment and (c) 5:00 p.m., new york city time, on february 19, 2020 (the “termination date”). pursuant to the commitment letter, for the period from the date of the commitment letter until the earliest of (a) the mutual agreement by the parties thereto not to execute definitive documentation relating to the commitment, (b) the closing date, and (c) the termination date, boxwood agreed (i) not to, without the prior written consent of gso, directly or indirectly solicit, participate in any negotiations or discussion with, or provide or afford access to information to, any third party with respect to, or otherwise effect, facilitate, encourage or accept any offers for the purchase or provision of, the preferred units or any alternative equity or debt financing arrangements (other than the credit facilities or the issuance of, or continued investment in, class a common stock), in each case, to be put in place in connection with the business combination, and (ii) to terminate any written agreement or arrangement related to the foregoing set forth in clause (i) above (other than the credit facilities) to which boxwood is a party, as well as any related activities and discussions with any party related to the foregoing set forth in clause (i) above other than with gso. boxwood will pay all of gso’s reasonable and documented fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with the issuance of the preferred units and the class a common stock it has committed to purchase. terms of the preferred units ranking the preferred units will rank senior in priority to all other existing and future equity securities of holdings with respect to liquidation preference and distribution rights. liquidation preference the preferred units will have a liquidation preference of $1,000 per preferred unit (the “liquidation preference”), plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. dividends subject to any limitations set forth in the credit facilities, the preferred units will pay a cash dividend of 5% per annum, plus either an additional 6.25% per annum in cash or 7.25% per annum in additional preferred units, at holdings’ option, payable quarterly in arrears. if a cash dividend is not able to be made because of a limitation under the credit facilities, then such dividend will convert into a dividend of additional preferred units at a rate of 14.25% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, until cash dividend payments can be made. voting the preferred units will not possess voting rights. conversion the preferred units will not be convertible into any other security of holdings. redemption holdings may redeem the preferred units (i) within the first two years of the closing date at a customary make-whole premium with a discount rate set at the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points, (ii) beginning on the second anniversary of the closing date at a price of 103% of the liquidation preference (the “redemption premium”), and (iii) after the third anniversary of the closing date at the liquidation preference. 2 subject to the terms of holdings’ and its subsidiaries’ senior credit agreements, holdings will be required to redeem the preferred units at the redemption premium in the event of (i) a change of control, (ii) sales or other dispositions of all or substantially all of holdings’ assets, (iii) insolvency/bankruptcy of holdings or the target, (iv) an acceleration under any of the debt facilities of holdings or its subsidiaries in an amount equal to or greater than $12 million, (v) a payment default on the preferred units that has not been cured within 5 business days of the issuer’s receipt of written notice from gso, (vi) a default under the preferred unit protective provisions, (vii) a final judgement default against holdings or any of its subsidiaries in an amount equal to or greater than $12 million that is not paid or covered by insurance, or (viii) an actual or asserted invalidity or enforceability of the holdings operating agreement or gso subscription agreement by the spac, holdings or any of its subsidiaries. finally, holders of the preferred units may require holdings to redeem their preferred units at the liquidation preference, beginning on the eighth anniversary of the closing date. covenants of holdings the terms of the preferred units are expected to include customary covenants for preferred equity, including limitations on debt incurrence, equity issuances and the payments of dividends. registration rights if gso purchases shares of class a common stock, it will be entitled to customary demand and piggyback registration rights. board observer following the closing date, gso will have the right to appoint one non-voting observer to boxwood’s boards of directors. the foregoing description of the commitment letter does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the

payment letter agreement with gso, dated january 23, 2020 (the “payment letter”), pursuant to which boxwood has agreed to pay to gso 2% of the aggregate amount of the liquidation preference of the preferred units purchased by gso on the closing date (which will be in the form of an original issue discount on such preferred units). in addition, gso will be entitled to receive 1,200,000 shares of boxwood’s class f common stock (the “founder shares”), subject to adjustment in the event that boxwood issues shares of class a common stock to investors in connection with the business combination at a price below $10 (without taking into account any founder shares that may be received by such investors). such founders shares will be subject to the same lock-up provisions as set forth in the letter agreement dated november 15, 2019, among boxwood, boxwood sponsor, llc (the “sponsor”) and the other signatories thereto the foregoing description of the payment letter does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the payment letter, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 10.2 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. purchase agreement amendment on january 23, 2020, boxwood entered into amendment no. 1 to the purchase agreement by and among boxwood, holdings, buyer, atlas intermediate and the seller (the “purchase agreement amendment”). the purchase agreement amendment was entered into by the parties principally to (i) provide amendments necessary to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the commitment letter, (ii) increase the number of rollover units the seller will receive as consideration by up to 5,000,000 holdings units at $10.00 per holdings unit to the extent of the redemptions and (iii) reflect the purchase of long engineering, inc. (“long engineering”) by atlas intermediate following the closing. 3 pursuant to the purchase agreement amendment, the purchase price to be paid by the buyer is $617 million, subject to customary adjustments contained in the purchase agreement amendment. of this amount, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement amendment, the buyer will pay off the existing net debt of the seller which is anticipated to be approximately $160 million, and the seller will receive aggregate consideration of approximately $457 million (inclusive of the seller’s transaction fees), which will consist of (i) between $210 million and $337 million of cash (the “cash consideration”) and (ii)(a) between $120.0 and $247.0 of holdings units, with each such holdings unit valued at $10.00 per holdings unit (subject to adjustment in accordance with the purchase agreement amendment) (the “rollover units”), and (b) shares of class b common stock of boxwood; provided that if the cancellation (as defined below) occurs, the seller will receive an additional $17,500,000 of holdings units. for each holdings unit received by the seller as consideration, the company will issue to the seller one share of class b common stock. the final amount of cash and the final value of the rollover units are dependent on the amount of money remaining in the trust account following the redemptions, and the amount of additional proceeds (if any) raised by the company through equity financing sources prior to the closing, which is anticipated to include the commitment. for more details on the determination of the mix of cash and equity to be paid to the seller, see the section entitled “amendment to the debt commitment letter” below. in addition, if the aggregate net proceeds of any investment in boxwood, holdings or target, other than that anticipated to be received from gso for the preferred units, together with the funds remaining in the trust account following the redemptions, is less than $50.0 million, boxwood agreed to cancel for no consideration 1,750,000 founder shares held by the sponsor (the “cancellation”) the foregoing description of the purchase agreement amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement amendment, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 10.3 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. forfeiture agreement on january 23, 2020, the sponsor and the seller entered into a forfeiture agreement (the “forfeiture agreement”) pursuant to which the sponsor agreed to perform its obligation to deliver 1,750,000 founder shares for cancellation in connection with the cancellation, if applicable. the foregoing description of the forfeiture agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the forfeiture agreement, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 10.4 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. amendment to the debt commitment letter on january 23, 2020, in connection with boxwood’s entry into the commitment letter and the purchase agreement amendment, boxwood entered into amendment no. 1 to the debt commitment letter (the “amendment”) with the commitment parties pursuant to which boxwood and the commitment parties have agreed to, among other things, reduce the aggregate principal amount of the credit facilities to be provided by the commitment parties from up to $400.0 million to up to $321.0 million by reducing the aggregate principal amount available under the first lien term facility from $290.0 million to $281.0 million and eliminating the second lien term facility, which would have been available for an aggregate principal amount of up to $70 million. in addition, the amendment changes the mix of cash and equity to be provided to the seller that was set forth in the debt commitment letter to provide that: (a)to the extent that the common equity contribution is greater than $10.0 million, the number of rollover units shall be reduced (and the cash consideration to the seller shall be increased) on a dollar-for-dollar basis until the value of rollover units received by the seller is equal to $120.0 million; and (b)to the extent that there remains any amount of common equity contribution after reducing the equity rollover in accordance with clause (a) above, the company shall (i) reduce the preferred commitment until the amount of the preferred commitment is equal to $130.0 million or (ii) reduce the amount of the commitment parties’ aggregate commitments in respect of the first lien term facility or (iii) reduce a combination of both the preferred commitment (but in any event, not below $130.0 million) and the first lien term facility, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 4 the amendment adjusts the condition precedent to the commitment parties’ obligation to provide the credit facilities from $100.0 million of available equity to $155.0 million (of which no more than $145.0 million will consist of the preferred commitment), of available equity the
