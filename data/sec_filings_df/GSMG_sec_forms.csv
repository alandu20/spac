developments share exchange agreement on february 14, 2020, tkk consummated the business combination contemplated by the share exchange agreement pursuant to which the company acquired 100% of the equity interests of glory star from the sellers. upon closing of the business combination, the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of glory star in exchange for (i) approximately 41,204,025 of our ordinary shares (“closing payment shares”), or one ordinary share for approximately 0.04854 outstanding shares of glory star, of which 2,060,201 of the closing payment shares (the “escrow shares”) shall be deposited into escrow to secure certain indemnification obligations of the sellers, plus (ii) earnout payments consisting of up to an additional 5,000,000 of our

performance targets for the 2020 fiscal year (the “earnout shares”). in the event that a financial performance target is not met for the 2019 fiscal year and/or 2020 fiscal year but we meet certain financial performance targets for the 2019 fiscal year and 2020 fiscal year combined, the sellers will be entitled to receive any earnout shares that they otherwise did not receive (the “alternative

seller party thereto will be allowed to transfer any of our restricted securities (other than the escrow shares while they are held in the escrow account) by gift, will or intestate succession or to any affiliate, shareholder, members, party or trust beneficiary, provided in each such case that the transferee thereof agrees to be bound by the restrictions set forth in the applicable lock-up agreement. 4 - tkk entered into a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement (“non-competition agreement”) with certain sellers that directly or indirectly own in excess of 30% of glory star’s equity prior to the closing (including glory star group’s chairman) and their principal shareholders (together with the applicable seller, the “subject parties”). under the non-competition agreements, for a period of three (3) years after the closing, each subject party and our affiliates will not, without our prior written consent, anywhere in the prc or any other markets directly or indirectly engage in which we are engaged, or are actively contemplating to become engaged, in the business (as defined below) (or own, manage, finance or control, or become engaged or serve as an officer, director, employee, member, partner, agent, consultant, advisor or representative of, an entity that engages in) of online media and entertainment services (collectively, the “business”). however, the subject parties and their respective affiliates may own passive investments of no more than 3% of any class of outstanding equity interests in a competitor that is publicly traded, so long as the subject parties and their affiliates and their respective directors, officers, managers and employees who were involved with the our business, and the immediate family members of the subject parties or their respective affiliates, are not involved in the management or control of such competitor. under the non-competition agreements, during such restricted period, the subject parties also will

gross merchandise value (“gmv”), achieving an impressive monthly gmv of rmb33.73 million (us$4.82 million) in december 2019, up from only rmb1.3 million (us$0.2 million) in april 2019. as of february 29, 2020, glory star group’s e-mall has recording over rmb 153.71 million (us$22.25 million) in gmv. glory star group believes that growth in the gmv will be driven significantly by glory star group’s ability to attract and retain users to the cheers app through its professionally-produced content and to further enhance its product offerings. daily active users (daus). glory star group defines daily active users, or daus, as a user who has logged in or access glory star group’s online video content and/or its e-commerce platform using the cheers app, whether on a mobile phone or tablet. glory star group calculates daus using internal company data based on the activity of the user account and as adjusted to remove “duplicate” accounts. dau is a tool that management uses to manage its operations. in particular, management sets daily targets of daus and monitors the daus to see whether to make adjustments as to its promotional activities, advertising campaign, and/or online video contents. on average for the years 2018 and 2019, the dau were 0.41 million and 1.91 million, respectively. the dau was 3.89 million on average for the month of february 2020. covid-19 affecting our results of operations in december 2019, covid-19 started to hit china, and then other parts of the world in early 2020. the pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and temporary closure of stores and facilities in china and elsewhere. with the rapid spread of covid-19, the global economy is under tremendous pressure and has triggered unprecedented policy changes in governments around the world. however, if the epidemic is not controlled in a timely manner, this could adversely affect china's business. we closely monitor the development of covid-19 and continuously evaluate the potential impact on our industry and company. although the covid-19 outbreak may materially adversely affect the global economic, there is a high rapid growth in the online entertainment and online consumption due to the restriction on outdoor activities. glory star group has seen a rapid growth in its mobile and online operation during this period. compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, the download number of cheers app has increased by 15%, daus has increased by 8%; and the monthly active users (“maus”) also get a 7% increase. the total video playback volume has exceeded 10 billion, which is a 33% increase compared to the average volume in year 2019. the average playback length of each video has increased by 10%. 6 glory star group’s e-mall also has had a rapid growth, while the daus of e-mall has increased by 7%, and the maus of e-mall also increased by 6% compared to the average dau and maus of year 2019. among them, the sales of electric products and household cleaning products have increased by 50% and 10%, respectively. glory star group has confidence in the overall market positioning and strategy. with a strong and efficient execution, glory star group believes that its operating net income increase and will provide more valuable content and products to the users and customers. critical accounting policies (a) basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (""u.s. gaap""). the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of glory star group, its subsidiaries, its vies and its vies’ subsidiaries. all inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. (b) use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and accompanying notes, including allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for unamortized production content, the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and revenue recognition. actual results could differ from those estimates. (c) accounts receivable, net accounts receivable represent the amounts that glory star group has an unconditional right to consideration when glory star group has satisfied its performance obligation. glory star group does not have any contract assets since revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred and the payment from customers is not contingent on a future event. glory star group maintains allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyses historical bad debt, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to estimate the allowance. past due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for bad debts only after all collection attempts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. (d) unamortized produced content produced content includes direct production costs, production overhead and acquisition costs and is stated at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated fair value. produced content also includes cash expenditures made to enter into arrangements with third parties to co-produce certain of its productions. glory star group uses the individual-film-forecast-computation method and amortizes the produced content based on the ratio of current period actual revenue (numerator) to estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the fiscal year (denominator) in accordance with asc 926. ultimate revenue estimates for the produced content are periodically reviewed and adjustments, if any, will result in prospective changes to amortization rates. when estimates of total revenues and other events or changes in circumstances indicate that a film or television series has a fair value that is less than its unamortized cost, a loss is recognized currently for the amount by which the unamortized cost exceeds the film or television series’ fair value. for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2019, $16.3 million and $17.2 million were amortized to the cost of sales and as of december 31, 2018 and 2019, impairment allowance of $nil and $nil was recorded. 7 (e) property and equipment, net property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. cost represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing use. the cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. when assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income/loss in the year of disposition. estimated useful lives are as follows: estimated useful life electric equipment 3 years office equipment and furniture 3 - 5 years leasehold improvement shorter of useful life or lease term (f) intangible asset, net intangible asset is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and amortized in a method which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be consumed or otherwise used up. the balance of intangible asset represents software related to cheers app, a mobile application that allows its users to access its online store (e-mall), video content, live streaming, and online games. the software is acquired externally tailored to glory star group’s requirements and is amortized straight-line over 7 years in accordance with the way glory star group estimates to generate economic benefits from such software. (g) impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with asc topic 360, glory star group reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. glory star group recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. the amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. glory star group did not record any impairment charge for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2019. (h) leases in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board (the “fasb”) issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842), which is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after december 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. glory star group has adopted the topic 842 on january 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard to leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements. glory star group leases its offices, which are classified as operating leases in accordance with topic 842. under topic 842, lessees are required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) on the commencement date: (i) lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. at the commencement date, glory star group recognizes the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company’s incremental borrowing rate for the same term as the underlying lease. the right-of-use asset is recognized initially at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred, consisting mainly of brokerage commissions, less any lease incentives received. all right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment. no impairment for right-of-use lease assets as of december 31, 2019. 8 glory star group’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. (i) advances from customers advances from customers amounted to $0.25 million and $0.61 million at december 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, which represent advance payment received from our customers for merchandise that had not yet been shipped or services that had not yet been provided. glory star group will recognize the advances as revenue when it has transferred control of the goods or services to which the advances relate, and has no obligation under the contract to transfer additional goods or services, and the consideration received from the customer is non-refundable. (k) revenue recognition glory star group early adopted the new revenue standard accounting standards codification (“asc”) 606, revenue from contracts with customers, starting january 1, 2017 using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of december 31, 2016. the adoption of this asc 606 did not have a material impact on glory star group’s consolidated financial statements. the core principle of this new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which glory star group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: ●step 1: identify the contract with the customer ●step 2: identify the performance obligations in the contract ●step 3: determine the transaction price ●step 4: allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract ●step 5: recognize revenue when glory star group satisfies a performance obligation glory star group mainly offers and generates revenue from the copyright licensing of self-produced content, advertising and customized content production and others. revenue recognition policies are discussed as follows: copyright revenue glory star group self produces or coproduces tv series featuring lifestyle, culture and fashion, and licenses the copyright of the tv series on an episode basis to the customer for broadcast over a period of time. generally, glory star group signs a contract with a customer which requires glory star group to deliver a series of episodes that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. accordingly, the delivery of the series of episodes is defined as the only performance obligation in the contract. for the tv series produced solely by glory star group, glory star group satisfies its performance obligation over time by measuring the progress toward the delivery of the entire series of episodes which is made available to the licensee for exhibition after the license period has begun. therefore, the copyright revenue in a contract is recognized over time based on the progress of the number of episodes delivered. glory star group also coproduces tv series with other producers and licenses the copyright to third-party video broadcast platforms for broadcast. for tv series produced by glory star group with co-producers, glory star group satisfies its performance obligations over time by the delivery of the entire series of episodes to the customer, and requires the customer to pay consideration based on the number and the unit price of valid subsequent views of the tv series that occur on a broadcast platform. therefore, the copyright revenue is recognized when the later of the valid subsequent view occurs or the performance obligation relating to the delivery of a number of episodes has been satisfied. 9 advertising revenue glory star group generates revenue from sales of various forms of advertising on its tv series and streaming content by way of 1) advertisement displays, or 2) the integration of promotion activities in tv series and content to be broadcast. advertising contracts are signed to establish the different contract prices for different advertising scenarios, consistent with the advertising period. glory star group enters into advertising contracts directly with the advertisers or the third-party advertising agencies that represent advertisers. for contracts that involve third-party advertising agencies, glory star group is principal as glory star group is responsible for fulfilling the promise of providing advertising services and has the discretion in establishing the price for the specified advertisement. under a framework contract, glory star group receives separate purchase orders from advertising agencies before the broadcast. accordingly, each purchase order is identified as a separate performance obligation, containing a bundle of advertisements that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. where collectability is reasonably assured, revenue is recognized monthly over the service period of the purchase order. for contracts signed directly with the advertisers, glory star group commits to display a series of advertisements which are substantially the same or similar in content and transfer pattern, and the display of the whole series of advertisements is identified as the single performance obligation under the contract. glory star group satisfies its performance obligations over time by measuring the progress toward the display of the whole series of advertisements in a contract, and advertising revenue is recognized over time based on the number of advertisements displayed. payment terms and conditions vary by contract types, and terms typically include a requirement for payment within a period from 3 to 6 months. both direct advertisers and third-party advertising agencies are generally billed at the end of the display period and require glory star group to issue vat invoices in order to make their payments. however, because the local government tax authority uses a quota system to manage the vat tax, it normally either delays the vat invoices issued or does not issue sufficient vat invoices. as such, glory star group is not able to provide sufficient vat invoices on a timely manner and results in increased account receivables. customized content production revenue glory star group produces customized short streaming videos according to its customers’ requirement, and earns fixed fees based on delivery. revenue is recognized upon the delivery of short streaming videos. cheers e-mall marketplace service revenue glory star group through cheers e-mall, an online e-commerce platform, enables third-party merchants to sell their products to consumers in china. glory star group charges fees for platform services to merchants for sales transactions completed on the cheers e-mall including but not limited to products displaying, promotion and transaction settlement services. glory star group does not take control of the products provided by the merchants at any point in the time during the transactions and does not have latitude over pricing of the merchandise. transaction services fee is determined as the difference between the platform sales price and the settlement price with the merchants. cheers e-mall marketplace service revenue is recognized at a point of time when glory star group’s performance obligation to provide marketplace services to the merchants are determined to have been completed under each sales transaction upon the consumers confirming the receipts of goods. payments for services are generally received before deliveries. 10 glory star group provides coupons at its own discretion as incentives to promote cheers e-mall marketplace with validity usually less than two months, which can only be used in future purchases of eligible merchandise offered on cheers e-mall to reduce purchase price that are not specific to any merchant. consumers are not customers of glory star group, therefore incentives offered to consumers are not considered consideration payable to customers. as the consumers are required to make future purchases of the merchants’ merchandise to redeem these coupons, glory star group does not accrue any expense for coupons when granted and recognizes the amounts of redeemed coupons as marketing expenses when future purchases are made. other revenues other revenue primarily consists of copyrights trading of purchased tv-series and the sales of products on taobao platform. for copyright licensing of purchased tv-series, glory star group recognizes revenue on net basis at a point of time upon the delivery of master tape and authorization of broadcasting right. for sales of product, glory star group recognizes revenue upon the transfer of products according to the fixed price and production amount in sales orders. the following table identifies the disaggregation of our revenue for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively: for the years ended december 31, 2018 2019 (usd in the thousands) category of revenue: advertising revenue $34,883 $48,391 copyrights revenue 13,383 7,369 customized content production revenue 7,707 9,098 cheers e-mall marketplace service revenue - 670 other revenue 383 249 total $56,356 $65,777 timing of revenue recognition: services transferred over time $55,973 $64,858 services transferred at a point in time - 670 goods transferred at a point in time 383 249 total $56,356 $65,777 glory star group applied a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. glory star group does not have any significant incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers incurred and/or costs incurred in fulfilling contracts with customers within the scope of asc topic 606, that shall be recognized as an asset and amortized to expenses in a pattern that matches the timing of the revenue recognition of the related contract. (l) income taxes glory star group accounts for income taxes using the asset/liability method prescribed by asc 740, “income taxes.” under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. glory star group records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date. 11 the provisions of asc 740-10-25, “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes,” prescribe a more-likely-than not threshold for consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken (or expected to be taken) in a tax return. this interpretation also provides guidance on the recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and related disclosures. glory star group does not believe that there was any uncertain tax position at december 31, 2018 and 2019. glory star group’s operating subsidiaries in prc are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. according to the prc tax administration and collection law, the statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. the statute of limitations is extended to five years under special circumstances, where the underpayment of taxes is more than rmb 100,000 ($14,364). in the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitation is ten years. there is no statute of limitation in the case of tax evasion. as of december 31, 2019, the tax years ended december 31, 2016 through december 31, 2019 for glory star group’s prc subsidiaries remain open for statutory examination by prc tax authorities. (m) recent accounting pronouncements in june 2016, the fasb amended guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments as part of asu 2016-13, financial instruments—credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. for public business entities that are u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) filers, the amendments in this update are effective for

generally accepted accounting principles. the amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted upon issuance of this asu. glory star group does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as a result of adopting the new standard. in march 2019, the fasb issued asu no. 2019-02, entertainment-films-other assets-film costs (subtopic 926-20) and entertainment-broadcasters-intangibles-goodwill and other (subtopic 920-350): improvements to accounting for costs of films and license agreements for program materials. the objective of asu 2019-02 is to better reflect the economics of an episodic television series,

adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. glory star group does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures. 12 results of operations comparison of results of

three-year term. the term of office for class a directors, consisting of ms. ng will expire at our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. the term of office of the class b directors, consisting of messrs. jia lu and yong li, will expire at the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders and the term of office of the class c directors, consisting of messrs. bing and leung, will expire at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. our officers are elected by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate. our memorandum and articles of association provide that our officers may consist of a chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, vice presidents, secretary, assistant secretaries, treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. director independence currently, each of messrs. ming shu leung and yong li, and ms. joanne ng would be considered an “independent director” under the nasdaq listing rules, which is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. committees of the board of directors our board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a nominating committee and a compensation committee. subject to phase-in rules and certain limited exceptions, the rules of nasdaq and rule 10a-3 of the exchange act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and the rules of nasdaq require that the compensation committee and nominating committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. audit committee we have established an audit committee of the board of directors, which consists of messrs. ming shu leung and yong li, and ms. joanne ng, each of whom is an independent director under nasdaq’s listing standards. mr. leung is the chairperson of the audit committee. the audit committee’s duties, which are specified in our audit committee charter, include, but are not limited to: ●reviewing and discussing with management and the independent auditor the annual audited financial statements, and recommending to the board whether the audited financial statements should be included in our annual report; ●discussing with management and the independent auditor significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of our financial statements; ●discussing with management major risk assessment and risk management policies; ●monitoring the independence of the independent auditor; 13 ●verifying the rotation of the lead (or coordinating) audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit as required by law; ●reviewing and approving all related-party transactions; ●inquiring and discussing with management our compliance with applicable laws and regulations; ●pre-approving all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditor, including the fees and terms of the services to be performed; ●appointing or replacing the independent auditor; ●determining the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor (including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work; ●establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; and ●approving reimbursement of expenses incurred by our management team in identifying potential target businesses. financial experts on audit committee the audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of “independent directors” who are “financially literate” as defined under nasdaq listing standards. nasdaq listing standards define “financially literate” as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company’s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. in addition, we must certify to nasdaq that the committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individual’s financial sophistication. the board of directors has determined that messrs. ming shu leung and yong li, and ms. joanne ng each qualify as an “audit committee financial expert,” as defined under rules and regulations of the sec. nominating committee we have established a nominating committee of the board of directors, which consists of messrs. ming shu leung and yong li, and ms. joanne ng, each of whom is an independent director under nasdaq’s listing standards. ms. ng is the chairperson of the nominating committee. the nominating committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on our board of directors. the nominating committee considers persons identified by its members, management, shareholders, investment bankers and others. guidelines for selecting director nominees the guidelines for selecting nominees, which are specified in the nominating committee charter, generally provide that persons to be nominated: ●should have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business, education or public service; ●should possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make a significant contribution to the board of directors and bring a range of skills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and ●should have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism and intense dedication to serving the interests of the shareholders. the nominating committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person’s candidacy for membership on the board of directors. the nominating committee may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board members. the nominating committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders and other persons. 14 compensation committee we have established a compensation committee of the board of directors, which consists of messrs. ming shu leung and yong li, and ms. joanne ng, each of whom is an independent director under nasdaq’s listing standards. mr. li is the chairperson of the compensation committee. the compensation committee’s duties, which are specified in our compensation committee charter, include, but are not limited to: ●reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our chief executive officer’s compensation, evaluating our chief executive officer’s performance in light

executive officers and employees; ●if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and ●reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. board leadership structure and role in risk oversight no policy exists requiring combination or separation of leadership roles and our governing documents do not mandate a particular structure. this has allowed our board the flexibility to establish the most appropriate structure for the company at any given time. the board is actively involved in overseeing our risk management processes. the board focuses on our general risk management strategy and ensures that appropriate risk mitigation strategies are implemented by management. further, operational and strategic presentations by management to the board include consideration of the challenges and risks of our businesses, and the board and management actively engage in discussion on these topics. in addition, each of the board’s committees considers risk within its area of responsibility. involvement in certain legal proceedings to the best of our knowledge, during the past ten years, none of our directors or executive officers were involved in any of the following: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; and (4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the securities and exchange commission or the commodities futures trading commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated. section 16(a) beneficial ownership reporting compliance section 16(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, requires our officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the sec. these reporting persons are also required to furnish us with copies of all section 16(a) forms they file. based solely upon a review of such forms, we believe that during the year ended december 31, 2019 there were no delinquent filers. 15

or more officers serving on our board of directors. code of ethics we have adopted a code of ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. we have filed a copy of our code of ethics and

will be held back by tkk symphony and not paid until the escrow shares are released from escrow to the sellers, but the sellers will be entitled to vote the escrow shares. after the closing, the sellers will have the contingent right to receive additional consideration from tkk symphony based on the performance of tkk symphony and its subsidiaries (including the glory star group) for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 (the “2019 earnout year”) and the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 (the “2020 earnout year”). in the event that the adjusted net income for the 2019 earnout year

adjusted net income for the 2020 earnout year is equal to or greater than rmb315,000,000, the sellers shall be entitled to receive an additional 5,000,000 ordinary shares (the “2020 earnout shares”,

(other than the escrow shares while they are held in the escrow account) by gift, will or intestate succession or to any affiliate, shareholder, members, party or trust beneficiary, provided in each such case that the transferee thereof agrees to be bound by the restrictions set forth in the applicable lock-up agreement. 7 the form of the lock-up agreement is filed with this current report on
