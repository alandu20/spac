acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of lion (the “purchased shares”) from the sellers in exchange for class a and class b ordinary shares of pubco, with lion becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of pubco (the “share exchange”, and together with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement, the “transactions”). exchange
