contained in this item 8.01 to supplement the risk factors described in item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, as filed with the securities and exchange commission on october 30, 2019.supplemental risk factorpandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the novel coronavirus (“covid-19”), may disrupt our business, including, among other things, consumption and trade patterns, our supply chain and production processes, each of which could materially affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as covid-19, could negatively affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. while to date we have experienced no material negative effects on our business and results of operations as a result of the current covid-19 outbreak, the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change, including but not limited to changes that may materially affect the operations of our customers and supply chain partners, which ultimately could result in material negative effects on our business and results of operations.covid-19 and similar outbreaks may affect demand for our products because quarantines or other government restrictions on movements may cause erratic consumer purchase behavior. governmental or societal impositions of restrictions on public gatherings, especially if prolonged in nature, may have adverse effects on in-person traffic to retail stores and, in turn, our business. even the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect traffic to our store-based retail customers and, in turn, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if any self-imposed or government-imposed restrictions are in place for a significant amount of time.the spread of pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks such as covid-19 may also disrupt our third party business partners’ ability to meet their obligations to us, which may negatively affect our operations. these third parties include those who supply our ingredients, packaging, and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, distributors, and logistics and transportation services providers. ports and other channels of entry may be closed or operate at only a portion of capacity, as workers may be prohibited or otherwise unable to report to work, and means of transporting products within regions or countries may be limited for the same reason. as a result of the current covid-19 outbreak, transport restrictions related to quarantines or travel bans have been put in place and global supply may become constrained, each of which may cause the price of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products to increase and/or we may experience disruptions to our operations. further, our contract manufacturers’ ability to manufacture our products may be impaired by any material disruption to their procurement, manufacturing, or warehousing capabilities as a result of covid-19 or similar outbreaks. our results of operations depend on, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing customers, to attract new consumers and to provide products that appeal to consumers at prices they are willing and able to pay. our ability to implement our innovation, advertising, display and promotion activities that are designed to maintain and increase our sales volumes on a timely basis may be negatively affected as a result of modifications to retailer shelf reset timing or retailer pullback on in-store display and promotional activities during the covid-19 outbreak or similar situations. retailers may also alter their normal inventory receiving and product restocking practices during pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks such as covid-19, which may negatively impact our businessworkforce limitations and travel restrictions resulting from pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks such as covid-19 and related government actions may affect many aspects of our business. if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, our operations may be negatively affected. in addition, pandemics or disease outbreaks could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customers’ demand for our products.adverse and uncertain economic conditions, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income, increased unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence as a result of the covid-19 outbreak or similar situations, could have an adverse effect on distributor, retailer and consumer demand for our products. consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns. prolonged unfavorable economic conditions, including as a result of covid-19 or similar outbreaks, and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth, may have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.our efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of any pandemic, epidemic or disease outbreak, as well as third party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate public health effects.item 9.01 financial statements and

related to the sale of the company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, by atkins holdings llc, a stockholder of the company and an affiliate of roark capital group, in an underwritten public offering (the “offering”). the prospectus supplement contains certain disclosure under the section “summary” which is set forth below: our strengths powerful brand with strong consumer awareness and loyalty. we are a leading player in the fast growing nutritional snacking category, and atkins is one of the only brands with scale in both nutrition bars and rtd shakes. the atkins iconic brand has 85% aided brand awareness with u.s. consumers today, based on a study conducted by atkins in january 2016. atkins continues to add new consumers, as demonstrated by a 6% compound annual increase in its consumer base over the past five fiscal years. its highly-focused snacking portfolio provides us with a unique position within retailers’ nutrition and wellness aisles, resulting in meaningful shelf space. atkins’ ability to appeal to both weight management program consumers and consumers focused on everyday nutritious eating makes it a highly attractive and strategic brand for a diverse set of retailers across various distribution channels. aligned with consumer mega trends. increasing global concern about growing rates of obesity and weight-related diseases and other health issues has resulted in increased scientific, media and consumer focus on nutrition. over 100 independent, peer reviewed, clinical studies show the benefits of controlling carbohydrates. management believes that this focus is prompting consumers to rebalance their nutritional breakdown away from carbohydrates. in fact, 73% of consumers are seeking to lower their carbohydrate intake according to health focus international. atkins brand attributes, “low carb,” “low sugar” and “protein rich” nutrition, are well aligned with consumer mega trends. in addition, consumers’ eating habits are gradually shifting towards increased convenience, snacking and meal replacement. our portfolio of convenient and nutritious products as well as our ongoing eff ort to meet consumer demands for “cleaner labels,” which we define as products made with fewer, simpler and more recognizable ingredients, are strategically aligned with these trends. scalable snacking and food platform. with the highly-recognized atkins brand as an anchor, we have been able to grow our product offerings through our brand extensions such as atkins harvest trail and via acquisitions such as the december 2016 acquisition of wellness foods. our in-house product development experience, combined with our outsourced manufacturing model, allow us to bring new products to market quickly. we pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and mining insights that lead to new products and ideas. we believe that we have the ability to leverage our strong relationships with our retail customers and distributors, brand building record, and category management expertise to help new products, brands and brand extensions gain distribution and consumer recognition, allowing us to continue to successfully expand our snacking platform. asset-light business with strong cash generation. we retain core in-house capabilities including sales and marketing, brand management, customer relationships, product development, and supply-chain know-how, while partnering with a diversified pool of contract manufacturers and distributors to execute manufacturing and distribution. outsourcing these competencies allows us to focus our eff orts on innovation, marketing and sales to strive to meet consumer demands. our lean infrastructure allows for significant flexibility and speed-to-market and minimal capital investment, which translates into consistent and robust free cash flow generation over time, driven by strong gross margins. experienced leadership team. simply good foods has an experienced team of industry veterans with extensive experience across multiple branded consumer products, food and nutrition categories. for example, our chief executive officer joseph scalzo has significant experience operating packaged foods businesses, having served in various leadership roles at dean foods, whitewave foods, the gillette company, the coca-cola company, and the procter & gamble company. simply good foods’ extensive experience is complemented by the significant industry expertise of james kilts, the former chief executive officer of the gillette company and nabisco, and former president of kraft usa and oscar mayer, and david west, the former chief executive officer of big heart pet brands and the hershey company. our management team’s deep expertise and proven track record in managing brands and operating packaged food businesses is a key driver of our success and positions simply good foods as an attractive vehicle for future long-term growth within the snacking space and broader food category. 2 our strategies continue our advocacy, education and activation for core program consumers. consumers who purchase atkins’ products have shown a strong affinity for the brand as evidenced by a relatively high level of servings per buyer, per year. historically, our core target consumer base has consisted of individuals participating in branded weight management programs. these consumers are our most loyal, profitable and frequent purchasers. we believe that social media is a cost-effective way of continuing to attract and retain these core consumers. we expect that the recently improved website and mobile application will continue to attract core consumers, including millennials, to our products. our marketing strategy also uses television and print behind our new celebrity spokeswoman lauren alaina and the “today’s atkins” campaign. we believe that our ongoing eff orts to educate consumers about the benefits of a lower carbohydrate lifestyle will further reinforce the brand to core consumers who are focused on a programmatic approach to weight management. further develop marketing strategy to reach self-directed low carbohydrate consumers. we intend to continue to make focused changes to our approach to consumer outreach. according to the information resources, inc. (“iri”) study, over 50% of current consumers are self-directed eaters (not on a program diet) who buy and consume our products, despite the fact that historically, atkins’ marketing and advertising have not been targeted towards them. based on a study we conducted in january 2016, we believe that the addressable market for our products is expandable from approximately 8 million low carbohydrate, program weight management consumers to approximately 46 million consumers, including individuals focused on self-directed weight management and those who have adopted a low carbohydrate approach to eating unrelated to weight management. this approach is reflected in our new campaign, “today’s atkins,” launched this past fall and continues to show that atkins extends beyond a diet, focusing on lowering intake of carbohydrates and reducing sugars. this campaign is represented by our new celebrity spokesperson, actor rob lowe, who has followed a low-carb approach for years. management expects that the brand’s redesigned marketing and advertising, such as our new spokesperson and our food-focused television advertising, will be effective at reaching the large addressable market of self-directed low carbohydrate consumers. additionally, social media continues to be an important component of our marketing tools and we have an active and growing presence on key social channels such as facebook, instagram, and twitter. during the 52-week period ended august 26, 2017, atkins had approximately 10 million new visitors to its website, www.atkins.com. innovate and expand the portfolio of product offerings to meet consumer demands for “cleaner labels,” higher protein products and new product forms. management expects that our ongoing eff orts to meet consumer demands for “cleaner labels,” which we define as products made with fewer, simpler and more recognizable ingredients, will be effective at reaching self-directed low carbohydrate consumers, who are focused on weight management as part of overall health, wellness and “clean eating.” management is committed to continually finding new and innovative formulations to reduce the number of product ingredients, as well as using “better for you” ingredients like nuts, fiber and whey protein in its existing products, while maintaining and improving taste and quality. in addition, we intend to continue to enhance, strengthen and expand our product offerings with new and innovative flavors and forms, simple ingredients and packaging alternatives, all while maintaining a commitment to delivering products that meet our nutritional profile and provide the convenience that consumers crave. our in-house research and development laboratory allows us to develop new products internally and bring them to market quickly through our contract manufacturing network without diverging from high standards of taste, quality, safety and nutritional content. additionally, we believe we will be able to meet consumer demands through merger and acquisition transactions, such as the december 2016 acquisition of wellness foods, a canada-based developer, marketer and seller of the simplyprotein® brand that is focused on “cleaner label,” protein-rich, and low-sugar products, which our management believes has significant opportunity for expansion in the u.s. expand distribution in white space opportunities. in the 52-week period ended august 26, 2017, over 80% of atkins’ gross sales were through the mass retailer and grocery distribution channels. management team believes there is opportunity for the brand to further penetrate other distribution channels such as convenience and club stores. management also believes that the development of the simplyprotein® brand will allow us to expand distribution into the natural and specialty channel. in addition, while shoppers have become heavy consumers of e-commerce purchases generally, only approximately 3% of atkins’ gross sales for the pro forma combined 52-week period ended august 26, 2017 were through its e-commerce channel. we intend to leverage our brand recognition to further develop the distribution channels through which it reaches consumers, including through the expansion of the e-commerce channel. leverage platform to expand in attractive food and snacking categories. management believes the fragmented snacking category presents a substantial opportunity for consolidation and the opportunity to build, through disciplined acquisitions, a leading platform in the snacking space and broader food category. as a leader in nutritious snacking, we believe we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform and customer relationships to expand beyond the atkins brand. our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building to expand the business into additional brands and products in the snacking segment. simply good foods is actively seeking to identify and evaluate new acquisition opportunities to complement the atkins platform, and sees significant opportunity for growth and synergies in complementary adjacent snacking categories such as the “better-for-you” eating space. as part of our previously announced acquisition strategy we continuously look for acquisitions. in our current acquisition pipeline we are in negotiations to purchase assets complimentary to our existing business that have $150 million to $200 million in annual revenues. we expect the purchase price to be less than one times the annual revenues. there is no assurance that this transaction or any transactions will be consummated. this current report on form 8-k shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the shares of common stock in the offering, nor shall there be any

interest rate and fees at the borrower’s election, the interest rate per annum applicable to the loans under the new credit facilities will be based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either (i) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (a) the “prime rate,” (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (c) the eurocurrency rate applicable for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) 3.00%, in the case of the term loans, or (y) 2.00%, in the case of the revolving credit facility or (ii) a eurocurrency

dispositions of property, subject to the ability to reinvest such proceeds and certain other exceptions, and subject to step downs if certain leverage ratios are met, (ii) 100% of the net cash

income tax receivable agreement with roark capital acquisition, as the stockholders representative (the “tax receivable agreement”). the tax receivable agreement will generally provide for the payment by simply good foods to the selling equityholders (as defined in the merger agreement) for certain federal, state, local and non-u.s. tax benefits deemed realized (as further described below) in post-closing taxable periods by simply good foods, conyers park, atkins and its eligible subsidiaries (collectively, the “tax group”) from the use of up to $100 million of the following tax attributes: (i) net operating losses available to be carried forward as of the closing of the business combination; (ii) certain deductions generated by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (iii) remaining depreciable tax basis from the 2003 acquisition of atkins nutritionals, inc. in addition, simply good foods will pay roark capital acquisition, acting as the stockholders’ representative, on behalf of the selling equityholders (as defined in the merger agreement) for the use of 75% of up to $7.6 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards (such alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and the tax attributes described in clauses (i)-(iii) of the previous sentence, collectively, the “tax attributes”). under the tax receivable agreement, the tax group is generally deemed to realize a tax benefit from the use of a tax attribute on a “with and without” basis, thereby generally treating the tax attribute as the last item used, except: (i) if in a given year a tax attribute would have been used but for simply good foods or one of its subsidiaries having completed an acquisition of one or more business entities (e.g., a new acquisition provides tax attributes that offset income that otherwise would have been offset by a tax attribute), then the tax group will be deemed to realize the benefit it would have realized in the absence of the subsequent acquisition, until the aggregate tax benefits for that year equals $13.2 million (with any excess carried forward and paid in a year when the realized tax benefit is otherwise less than $13.2 million); and (ii) if the applicable corporate tax rate (and resulting realized tax benefit) is lower than it would have been but for a change of the taxable year after the closing date of the business combination (e.g., because the change in tax year enabled the tax group to benefit sooner from a legislative rate reduction), then the realized tax benefit will be calculated using the original higher rate (solely for u.s. federal tax purposes) for twelve months following the change of taxable year. generally, simply good foods will pay the stockholders’ representative (as defined in the merger agreement) for the deemed realized tax benefit for each taxable year, except that the amount payable will be adjusted if the realized tax benefit for prior taxable years is subsequently re-determined to be lower or higher than originally calculated (e.g., due to an audit that invalidates a deduction). in addition, any amount otherwise payable under the tax receivable agreement will be reduced by the amount of any pre-closing income taxes of atkins borne by simply good foods (and any tax deductions arising from such income tax are generally treated as additional tax attributes). the stockholders’ representative (as defined in the merger agreement) is not required to repay any amounts previously paid under the tax receivable agreement. 5 as a result of the foregoing, in certain circumstances (i) simply good foods could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than or less than the actual tax savings that the tax group realizes in respect of the tax attributes and (ii) it is possible that simply good foods may be required to make payments years in advance of the actual realization of tax benefits in respect of the tax attributes. in these situations, simply good foods’ obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have an adverse impact on simply good foods’ liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. there can be no assurance that simply good foods will be able to finance its obligations under the tax receivable agreement in a manner that does not adversely affect its working capital and growth requirements. the foregoing description of the tax receivable agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the tax receivable agreement, which is attached hereto as exhibit 10.6 and is incorporated herein by reference. warrant amendment agreement on july 7, 2017, in connection with the closing of the business combination, the company entered into an assignment, assumption and amendment agreement (the “warrant amendment agreement”), by and among simply good foods, conyers park and continental stock transfer & trust company pursuant to which conyers park assigned all of its right, title and interest in the existing warrant agreement (as defined in the warrant amendment agreement) to simply good foods. as a result, the obligations under the existing warrant agreement are now obligations of the company and are no longer obligations of conyers park, and each new warrant (as defined below) is exercisable for one share of new common stock (as defined below). the foregoing description of the warrant amendment agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the warrant amendment agreement, which is attached hereto as exhibit 10.7 and is incorporated herein by reference. amended and restated employment agreement with joseph e. scalzo on july 7, 2017, the company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the “employment agreement”) with its chief executive officer and president, joseph e. scalzo. the initial term of the employment agreement is five years, and thereafter, the term automatically renews for additional one-year periods, unless either party provides 90 days’ written notice of non-renewal. the employment agreement provides mr. scalzo, among other things, with: (i) an initial base salary of $715,000, subject to increase (but not decrease) in the discretion of the board; (ii) a target annual bonus opportunity equal to (a) 75% of base salary for fiscal year 2017 and (b) 100% of base salary for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter; (iii) a grant of options to purchase 1.2 million shares of company common stock under the 2017 plan, which grant will be made no later than july 22, 2017 at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of one share of the company’s common stock as of the grant date; (iv) the opportunity to receive future equity and other long-term incentive awards, as determined in the board’s discretion; and (v) eligibility to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and policies maintained by the company for its senior executives generally, in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof as in effect from time to time. in the event of a termination of mr. scalzo’s employment by the company without “cause” (as defined in the employment agreement), by him for “good reason” (as defined in the employment agreement) or due to the company’s non-renewal of the term of the employment agreement (each, a “qualifying termination”), subject to his timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims and continued compliance with restrictive covenants, he is entitled to the following: (i) a pro-rated portion of his annual bonus for the termination year (if any), based on the company’s actual performance for the entire bonus year and his number of days of employment with the company during such year, paid on the same date that annual bonuses are paid to the company’s other executives (the “pro-rata bonus”); (ii) 24 months’ continued base salary (at the rate then in effect); (iii) an amount equal to two times his target annual bonus for the termination year, payable in substantially equal installments over the 24-month post-termination period; (iv) subject to his timely election of coverage under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985, as amended (“cobra”), and continued payment of the employee portion of the cobra premiums, up to 18 months’ continued participation in the company’s group health plan for him and his eligible dependents, subject to earlier termination in the event he becomes ineligible for cobra or obtains other employment that offers group health benefits; (v) pro-rata vesting of any outstanding incentive equity awards based on his duration of employment with the company from commencement of the then current vesting tranche through the termination date; and (vi) if such termination occurs after july 7, 2021 (a “retirement termination”), continued vesting of all of his outstanding incentive equity awards granted at least one year prior to the termination date, as if he had remained employed with the company and with any performance-based incentive equity awards vesting only to the extent that the underlying performance metrics are achieved, with his stock options to remain outstanding until their expiration date (collectively, the “retirement equity treatment”). if mr. scalzo violates any of the material restrictive covenants in the employment agreement (with a violation of the non-competition covenant deemed material) within two years of his retirement termination, then any (x) unvested equity awards and (y) incentive equity awards that vested following the retirement termination will be forfeited without payment of any consideration, and to the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing, mr. scalzo will be obligated to repay to the company any gain received in respect of such equity awards (collectively, the “retirement equity forfeiture provisions”). 6 in the event of a qualifying termination within the one-year period immediately following a change in control (as defined in the incentive plan), in addition to the severance benefits described above, mr. scalzo is entitled to accelerated vesting of all of his incentive equity awards outstanding as of the change in control, subject to his timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims. mr. scalzo also is entitled to such accelerated vesting upon a qualifying change in control (as defined in the employment agreement), regardless of whether a qualifying termination occurs. upon his resignation without good reason after july 7, 2022, subject to his timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims, mr. scalzo is entitled to the retirement equity treatment, subject to the retirement equity forfeiture provisions. upon a termination of his employment due to death or disability, mr. scalzo is entitled to the pro-rata bonus (which, in the event of a termination due to death, will be calculated based on his target annual bonus and paid within 30 days of death). the employment agreement subjects mr. scalzo to certain restrictive covenants, including perpetual confidentiality and mutual non-disparagement, assignment of inventions and non-competition and non-solicitation during the employment term and for 24 months post-employment. the foregoing description of the employment agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the employment agreement, which is attached hereto as exhibit 10.8 and is incorporated herein
