pursuant to the employment agreement will continue for a period of five years, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. during the employment period, the company is obligated to cause mr. colglazier to be nominated to stand for election to the board, unless an event constituting “cause” (as defined in the employment agreement) has occurred and not been cured or mr. colglazier has issued a termination notice. under the employment agreement, mr. colglazier is entitled to receive an initial annual base salary of $1,000,000, subject to annual review by the board or a subcommittee thereof and to increase in its discretion, and is eligible to receive an annual performance bonus targeted at 100% of his then-current annual base salary, ranging from 50% to 150% if minimum / threshold or maximum performance objectives are achieved (respectively). the actual amount of any annual bonus will be determined by reference to the attainment of applicable company and/or individual performance objectives, as determined by the board or a subcommittee thereof. mr. colglazier also is eligible to receive a one-time cash bonus equal to $1,000,000, one-half to be paid following the employment start date and one-half to be paid following the first anniversary of the employment start date, subject to his continued employment. in addition, mr. colglazier (i) will be eligible to

option and restricted stock unit awards, each of which will be granted on the employment start date. the stock option will cover 500,000 shares of the company’s common stock (the “stock option”), and the restricted stock unit will be granted as two awards: (i) one award covering 70,000 shares of the company’s common stock (the “signing rsu award”) and (ii) a second award covering 500,000 shares of the company’s common stock (the “additional rsu award”). the stock option is scheduled to vest in substantially equal monthly installments over the 60 months following the employment start date. half of the signing rsu award will be vested on the employment start date and half is scheduled to vest on the one year anniversary of such date. the additional rsu award is scheduled to vest as to 25% of the restricted stock units subject to the award on the one year anniversary of the employment start date and as to the remaining 75% in substantially equal quarterly installments over the following 12 quarters. each equity award is scheduled to vest subject to continued service, except as described below. if mr. colglazier experiences a “qualifying termination” of employment, then, in addition to any accrued amounts, he will be entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits: • a cash severance amount equal to the sum of (i) his annual base salary then in effect and (ii) his target annual bonus, multiplied by (a) 1.0 if the termination date occurs after the second anniversary of the employment start date or (b) 2.0 if the termination date occurs on or before the second anniversary of the employment start date. the multiplier also will equal 2.0 if the termination date occurs during the 24-month period following a “change in control” of the company. • pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination. • company-subsidized healthcare coverage for 12 - 18 months after the termination date. • accelerated vesting of any then-outstanding company equity awards that vest based solely on the passage of time. the accelerated vesting will cover the number of shares or restricted stock units that would have vested during the 12-month period following the termination date (or, if the termination occurs on or before the second anniversary of the employment start date, the 24-month period). however, if the termination occurs during the 24-month period following a change in control, then such equity awards will vest in full. • continued opportunity to receive the spaceflight described above (but not if his employment terminates due to his death or disability). a “qualifying termination” includes a termination of mr. colglazier’s employment (i) by the company without “cause”, (ii) by mr. colglazier for “good reason”, (iii) due to mr. colglazier’s death or disability or (iv) by reason of the company’s non-renewal of the employment agreement at the end of its term. the severance described above would be subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of the company and continued compliance with restrictive covenants. the employment agreement contains customary confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions, and also includes a “best pay” provision under section 280g of the internal revenue code, pursuant to which any “parachute payments” that become payable to mr. colglazier will be either paid in full or reduced so that such payments are not subject to the excise tax under section 4999 of the internal revenue code, whichever results in the better after-tax treatment to mr. colglazier. the foregoing description of mr. colglazier’s employment agreement, the stock option, the signing rsu award and the additional rsu award is qualified in its entirety by reference to the employment agreement, the form of restricted stock unit award agreement with michael colglazier and the form of stock option award agreement with michael colglazier, copies of which are filed

entitled to receive a stock option to purchase 320,840 shares of the company’s common stock and a restricted stock unit award covering 320,840 shares of the company’s common stock (the “whitesides rsu award”), each to be granted on july 20, 2020. the stock option is scheduled to vest in equal monthly installments over a two-year period following the grant date, and the whitesides rsu award is scheduled to vest in equal quarterly installments over the same period, in each case subject to continued service. in addition, mr. whitesides will remain eligible to earn a one-time cash bonus equal to $500,000, but it will be paid on the achievement of a commercial launch (rather than on the first anniversary of the commercial launch), subject to continued employment. mr. whitesides also will be entitled to receive reimbursement of up to $15,000 for legal fees incurred in connection with the negotiation of the amended employment agreement. if mr. whitesides experiences a “qualifying termination” of employment, then, in addition to any accrued amounts, he will be entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits: • a cash severance amount equal to 1.0 times the sum of (i) his annual base salary then in effect and (ii) his target annual bonus. the multiplier will equal 1.5 if the termination date occurs during the 24-month period following a “change in control” of the company. • company-subsidized healthcare coverage for 12 - 18 months after the termination date. • accelerated vesting of any then-outstanding company equity awards that vest based solely on the passage of time. • continued opportunity to receive the commercial flight bonus and the spaceflight described above. a “qualifying termination” includes a termination of mr. whitesides’ employment (i) by the company without “cause”, (ii) by mr. whitesides for “good reason” or (iii) by mr. whitesides for any reason after november 1, 2020. the severance described above would be subject to his
