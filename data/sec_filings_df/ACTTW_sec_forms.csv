3 risk factors the risks associated with the company are described in the proxy statement/prospectus in the section titled “risk factors,” and in the supplement in the section titled “update to risk factors,” each of which is incorporated herein by reference. in addition, the following risk factors have been updated since the filing of the supplement: our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. in connection with the business combination, on june 25, 2020, whole earth brands, inc. entered to into a senior secured credit facility consisting of (x) a term loan facility of up to $140,000,000 and (y) a revolving loan facility of up to $50,000,000, each maturing in five years. loans outstanding under these credit facilities are expected to accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to libor, with a liobr floor of 1.00%, plus a margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.75%, or, at company’s option, a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, libor for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, and 2.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin between 2.00% and 2.75%, with the margin in each case depending on the achievement of certain leverage ratios, and undrawn amounts under the first lien revolving loan facility are expected to accrue a commitment fee at a rate per annum of 0.40% on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments thereunder, with a step down to 0.30% upon achievement of certain leverage ratios. principal payments on the first lien term loan facility will be due quarterly, in amounts expected to be equal to (i) 1.25% per annum of the original principal amount of the first lien term loan facility during the first, second and third years after the closing date of the credit facilities and (ii) 2.50% per annum of the original principal amount of the first lien term loan facility during the fourth and fifth years after the closing date of the credit facilities. for additional information, refer to ""item 1.01. entry into material definitive agreement—credit agreement"" of this current report on form 8-k. our substantial indebtedness could: ·require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments in respect of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisition opportunities, a level of marketing necessary to maintain the current level of sales and other general corporate purposes; ·increase the amount of interest that we have to pay, because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will result in higher interest payments if interest rates increase, and, if and when we are required to refinance any of our indebtedness, an increase in interest rates would also result in higher interest costs; ·increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; ·require refinancing, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms; ·limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, competition and/or changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; ·limit our ability to borrow additional funds; ·restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or necessary divestitures, introducing new brands and/or products or exploiting business opportunities; and ·place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or more financial resources. we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful. our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend upon, among other things, (a) our future financial and operating performance (including the realization of any cost savings described herein), which will be affected by prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and (b) our future ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility, the availability of which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the credit agreement governing such facility. 4 we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to draw under our revolving credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, including the payment of principal and interest on our debt. if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. in addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. in the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and could negatively impact our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. whole earth brands, inc.’s indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition and ability to conduct its operations, and whole earth brands, inc. may incur additional debt the total indebtedness under the new credit facility may be equal to $190,000,000 (including an undrawn revolving credit facility of $50,000,000 at the date of closing). whole earth brands inc.’s debt level and the terms of its financing arrangements could adversely affect its financial condition and limit its ability to successfully implement its growth strategies. in addition, under its credit facilities, certain of whole earth brands, inc.’s direct subsidiaries granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of their assets. whole earth brands, inc. is permitted under the terms of its credit facilities to incur additional indebtedness, both under its credit facilities and otherwise. if such additional indebtedness is incurred, it may exacerbate the risks of whole earth brands, inc.’s indebtedness described herein. whole earth brands, inc.’s ability to meet its debt service obligations will depend on whole earth brands, inc.’s future performance, which will be affected by the other risk factors described herein. if whole earth brands, inc. does not generate enough cash flow to pay its debt service obligations, it may be required to refinance all or part of its existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. whole earth brands, inc. may not be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on satisfactory terms, or at all. whole earth brands, inc.’s credit facilities will contain financial and other covenants. the failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect. whole earth brands, inc.’s credit facilities contemplated by the credit facilities documents contain certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 4.00:1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.25:1.00, and limitations on whole earth brands, inc.’s and its subsidiaries’ abilities to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and make guarantees; incur liens on assets; engage in mergers or consolidations, dissolutions or other fundamental changes; sell assets; pay dividends and distributions or other restricted payments or repurchase stock; make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions; amend organizational documents or other material agreements; enter into certain agreements that would restrict the ability of the borrower and its subsidiaries to pay dividends; repay certain junior, unsecured or subordinated indebtedness; issue certain equity; engage in certain activities; and engage in certain transactions with affiliates, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. any failure to comply with the restrictions of whole earth brands, inc.’s credit facilities may result in an event of default under the credit facilities. whole earth brands, inc.’s contemplated credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. if market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect whole earth brands, inc.’s cash flow. 5 financial information reference is
