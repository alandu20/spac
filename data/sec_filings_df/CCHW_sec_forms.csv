of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. collier creek’s and utz’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, collier creek’s and utz’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the proposed business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside collier creek’s and utz’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against collier creek and utz following the announcement of the business combination agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the proposed business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of collier creek or other conditions to closing in the business combination agreement; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (5) the amount of redemption requests made by collier creek’s shareholders; (6) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the post-business combination company’s common stock on the new york stock exchange following the proposed business combination; (7) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts current plans and operations; (8) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (9) costs related to the proposed business combination; (10) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (11) the possibility that utz or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the proposed business combination, including those included in the section “risk factors”, and in collier creek’s other filings with the sec. some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by the covid-19 outbreak and there may be additional risks that collier creek considers immaterial or which are unknown. it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. collier creek cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. collier creek cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. collier creek does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as otherwise required by law. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.
