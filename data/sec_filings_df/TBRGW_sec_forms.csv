securities and exchange commission (the “sec”) on june 24, 2019 by thunder bridge. item 1.01. entry into material definitive agreement. exchange agreement on july 11, 2019, in connection with the closing, the company entered into an exchange agreement (the “exchange agreement”) with repay and the other holders of class a units of repay (the “post-merger repay units”) which provides such other holders with the right to elect to exchange such post-merger repay units into shares of class a common stock (as described below). exchange mechanics holders of post-merger repay units (collectively, the “repay unitholders”) other than the company will, from and after the six-month anniversary of the closing, at any time and from time to time, be able to exchange all or any portion of their post-merger repay units for shares of class a common stock by delivering a written notice to both repay and the company and surrendering such post-merger repay units to the company; however no repay unitholder may exchange fewer than 10,000 post-merger repay units in any single exchange unless exchanging all of the post-merger repay units held by such holder at such time. the company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, in lieu of delivering shares of class a common stock for any post-merger repay units surrendered for exchange, pay an amount in cash per post-merger repay unit equal to the volume weighted average price of the class a common stock on the date it receives the written notice of the election to exchange from the exchanging repay unitholder. exchange ratio the initial exchange ratio will be one post-merger repay unit for one share of class a common stock. the exchange ratio will be adjusted for any subdivision (split, unit distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse unit split, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of the post-merger repay units that is not accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination of the class a common stock or, by any such subdivision or combination of the class a common stock that is not accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination of the post-merger repay units. if the class a common stock is converted or changed into another security, securities or other property, on any subsequent exchange an exchanging repay unitholder will be entitled to receive such security, securities or other property. the exchange ratio will also adjust in certain circumstances when the company acquires post-merger repay units other than through an exchange for its shares of class a common stock. restrictions on exchange the company may refuse to effect an exchange if the company determines that such exchange would violate applicable law (including securities laws), or not be permitted under other agreements between the exchanging repay unitholder and the company or its subsidiaries. the company may also limit the rights of repay unitholders to exchange their post-merger repay units under the exchange agreement if the company determines in good faith that such restrictions are necessary to prevent repay from being treated as a “publicly traded partnership” under applicable tax laws and regulations. 1 expenses repay and each repay unitholder will bear its own expense regarding any exchange, except that repay will be responsible for transfer tax, stamp taxes and similar duties (unless the applicable holder has requested that the company issue the shares of class a common stock in the name of another holder). this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the exchange agreement, which is included as exhibit 10.1 to this current report on form 8-k and is incorporated herein by reference. tax receivable agreement on july 11, 2019, in connection with the closing, the company entered into a tax receivable agreement (the “tax receivable agreement”) with the other repay unitholders. as described above, repay unitholders (other than the company) may, subject to certain conditions, from and after the six-month anniversary of the date of the completion of the business combination, exchange their post-merger repay units for shares of class a common stock of the company on a one-for-one basis, subject to the terms of the exchange agreement, including in certain cases adjustments as set forth therein. repay intends to have in effect an election under section 754 of the code for each taxable year in which an exchange of post-merger repay units for shares of class a common stock occurs, which is expected to result in increases to the tax basis of the assets of repay at the time of an exchange of post-merger repay units. the exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of repay. these increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that the company would otherwise be required to pay in the future. these increases in tax basis may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. the tax receivable agreement provides for the payment by the company to exchanging repay unitholders of 100% of the tax benefits, if any, that the company realizes (or in certain cases is deemed to realize) as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax attributes of repay and tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. this payment obligation is an obligation of the company and not of repay. for purposes of the tax receivable agreement, the cash tax savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of the company (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that the company would have been required to pay had there been no increase (or decrease) to the tax basis of the assets of repay as a result of the exchanges and had the company not entered into the tax receivable agreement. such increase or decrease will be calculated under the tax receivable agreement without regard to any transfers of post-merger repay units or distributions with respect to post-merger repay units before the exchange under the exchange agreement. the term of the tax receivable agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless the company exercises its right to terminate the tax receivable agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits of the tax receivable agreement. estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including: ●the timing of exchanges – for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair market value, which may fluctuate over time, of the depreciable or amortizable assets of repay at the time of each exchange; 2 ●the price of shares of the company’s class a common stock at the time of each exchange – the increase in any tax deductions, as well as the tax basis increase in other assets of repay, is directly proportional to the price of shares of the company’s class a common stock at the time of each exchange; ●the extent to which such exchanges are taxable – if an exchange is not taxable for any reason, increase deductions will not be available; and ●the amount and timing of our income – the company will be required to pay 100% of tax benefits as and when realized, under the terms of the tax receivable agreement. except as discussed below with respect to a material breach of a material obligation under the tax receivable agreement, a change of control, or other circumstances requiring an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, if the company does not have taxable income, it generally will not be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for that taxable year because no tax benefits will have actually been realized. however, any tax benefits that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate benefits in previous or future tax years. the utilization of such tax attributes will result in payments under the tax receivable agreement. we anticipate that we will account for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the tax receivable agreement arising from future exchanges as follows: ●we will record an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the exchange; ●to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation of future earnings, we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; ●we will record the estimated realizable tax benefit (which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance) as an increase to the liability due under the tax receivable agreement; and ●all of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the exchange will be included in net income. similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income. the company expects that, as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of repay, the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial. there may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual cash tax savings that the company realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and/or distributions to the company by repay are not sufficient to permit the company to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after it has paid taxes. late payments under the tax receivable agreement generally will accrue interest at an uncapped rate equal to libor plus 500 basis points. the payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by repay unitholders. the rights of each party under the tax receivable agreement other than the company are assignable. in addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that, if we materially breach any of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement of if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, the company’s (or its successor’s) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired post-merger repay units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions, including that the company would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. 3 furthermore, the company may elect to terminate the tax receivable agreement early by making an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future cash tax savings. in determining such anticipated future cash tax savings, the tax receivable agreement includes several assumptions, including that (i) any post-merger repay units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the shares of class a common stock at the time of termination, (ii) the company will have sufficient taxable income in each future taxable year to fully realize all potential tax savings, (iii) the tax rates for future years will be those specified in the law as in effect at the time of termination and (iv) certain non-amortizable assets are deemed disposed of within specified time periods. in addition, the present value of such anticipated future cash tax savings are discounted at a rate equal to libor plus 100 basis points. if the company were to elect to terminate the tax receivable agreement effective as of immediately after the business combination, the company currently estimates that it would be required to pay approximately $128.6 million to satisfy its total tax receivable agreement liability. as a result of the change of control provisions and the early termination right, the company could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than or less than the actual cash tax savings that the company realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement. in these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. decisions made by the company in the course of running the business may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by an exchanging or selling existing owner under the tax receivable agreement. for example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction generally will accelerate payments under the tax receivable agreement and increase the present value of such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase an existing owner’s tax liability without giving rise to any rights of an existing owner to receive payments under the tax receivable agreement. payments under the tax receivable agreement are based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. the company will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if a tax item is successfully challenged by the irs. as a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the company’s cash tax savings. this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the tax receivable agreement, which is included as exhibit 10.2 to this current report on form 8-k and is incorporated herein by reference. stockholders agreements in

periodic financial statements and other materials provided to the company’s board of directors, (ii) have consultation rights with the company’s officers and directors and other consultation rights reasonably necessary to qualify the vcoc investor’s investment in the company as a vcoc investment, and (iii) if the vcoc investor requests to receive such information and the rights, the right to receive advance notice of any significant corporate actions (with respect to events which require public disclosure, only following the company’s public disclosure thereof) and to consult with the company and its subsidiaries with respect to such corporation action. any transferee of the vcoc investor’s shares that are intended to hold a vcoc investment will have the same rights as the vcoc investor. corsair transfers. corsair can transfer its rights under the corsair stockholders agreement to its affiliates. corsair’s rights under the corsair stockholders agreement (other than with respect to the vcoc investor) will terminate when it and its affiliates collectively beneficially own less than 5% of the outstanding class a common stock (including pursuant to post-merger repay units that can be exchanged pursuant to the exchange agreement). sponsor stockholders agreement director appointment. under the stockholders agreement between the company and the sponsor (the “sponsor

as founder designees may only be removed upon termination of service as described above, and the independent founder designee may only be removed with the consent of the repay founders. in the event of any vacancy with respect to the seat of the independent founder designee, the company will use its best efforts to fill such vacancy with the person designated by the repay founders (and approved

corsair set forth in such written demand so long as such demand is for a number of shares with an aggregate offering price of at least $3,000,000 or all of the remaining shares owned by corsair. in addition, subject to certain exceptions, corsair will be entitled under the registration rights agreement to require that the company register the resale of any or all of the shares of the repay unitholders on form s-3 and any similar short-form registration that may be available at such time as a “shelf registration”, so long as such request is for a number of shares with an aggregate value of at least $2,000,000 or all of the remaining shares owned by corsair. if requested in writing by corsair, the company will also amend any “shelf registration” to increase the number of shares registered thereunder, so long as such request is for at least an additional number of shares with an aggregate value of $1,000,000 or all of the remaining shares owned by corsair. subject to certain customary exceptions, if the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to its securities, under the registration rights agreement, the company will give

subject to customary cutbacks in an underwritten offering. any other security holders of the company with piggyback registration rights may also participate in any such registrations, subject to customary cutbacks in an underwritten offering. the company has customary rights to postpone any registration statements including shares for certain events. if the registration is effected through an underwritten offering, the participating repay unitholders will agree to lockups that are agreed to by the demanding repay unitholder if it was a demand registration or otherwise by the company. 7 under the registration rights agreement, the company has agreed to indemnify the repay unitholders and each underwriter and each of their respective controlling persons against any losses or damages resulting from any untrue statement or omission of a material fact in any registration statement or prospectus pursuant to which they sell shares, unless such liability arises from their misstatement or omission, and repay unitholders have agreed to indemnify the company and its officers and directors and controlling persons against all losses caused by their misstatements or omissions in those documents. this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the registration rights agreement, which is included as exhibit 10.6 to this current report on form 8-k and is incorporated herein by reference. amendment to founders registration rights agreement on july 11, 2019, thunder bridge and the sponsor entered into a first amendment to the registration rights agreement, dated june 18, 2018 (the “founder registration rights agreement”), by and among thunder bridge, the sponsor, cantor fitzerald & company (“cantor”) and monroe capital, pursuant to which, among other things, the defined term registrable securities therein was amended to include the shares of class a common stock and warrants to purchase shares of class a common stock issued pursuant to the domestication, and the priority of underwriter cut-backs for piggy back registration rights thereunder was amended so that the holders of registrable securities under the founder registration rights agreement rank pari passu with the holders of shares under the registration rights agreement. this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the amendment to founders registration rights agreement, which is included as exhibit 10.7 to this current report on form 8-k and is incorporated herein by reference. credit agreement in connection with the business combination, on july 11, 2019, tb acquisition merger sub llc, repay and certain subsidiaries of repay, as guarantors, entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement (the “credit agreement”)

subject to certain terms and conditions. the facilities bear interest at rates based either on adjusted libor, plus a margin of between 2.50% and 3.50%, or, at repay’s option, a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and adjusted libor for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin of between 1.50% and 2.50%, with the

proceeds of (i) sales of certain assets, (ii) issuances of debt, and (iii) casualty or condemnation events (subject to specified thresholds and exceptions, including permitted reinvestment periods); and ●50% of “excess cash flow,” as defined in the credit agreement which is included as an exhibit to this this current report on form 8-k, with a reduction to 25% if the total net leverage ratio for the fiscal year is less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.00 but greater than 2.75:1.00, and a reduction to 0% if the total net leverage ratio for the fiscal year is less than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00. the credit agreement contains certain covenants, including affirmative and operational covenants and restrictive covenants regarding, among other matters, incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, investments, mergers, dispositions and specified uses of cash (including payment of dividends and distributions). the credit agreement also contains a covenant requiring repay to maintain a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 5.50 to 1.00, reducing periodically until the ratio becomes 3.50 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending on or after september 30, 2022. in general, the “total net leverage ratio” means, as of any date, the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness (net of unrestricted cash and permitted investments not to exceed $20.0 million) of repay and certain of its subsidiaries to consolidated ebitda of repay and certain of its subsidiaries for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended. this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the credit agreement, which is included as exhibit 10.8 to this current report on form 8-k and is incorporated herein by reference. item 2.01. completion of acquisition or disposition of assets. the disclosure set forth in the “introductory note” above is incorporated into this item 2.01 by reference. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the total consideration for the business combination and related transactions (the “merger consideration”) was approximately $580.7 million. adjusted for repay debt, excess transaction expenses, working capital adjustments, employee transaction bonuses and cash (in each case, estimated as of the closing), net proceeds to the pre-merger equity holders of repay (collectively, the “repay equity holders”) were approximately $481.3 million, consisting of approximately $260.8 million in cash and 22.0 million post-merger repay units. in connection with the shareholders meeting, holders of 7,019,741 thunder bridge class a ordinary shares sold in its initial public offering (“public shares”) exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash prior to the redemption deadline of july 8, 2019, at a price of approximately $10.33 per share, for an aggregate payment from thunder bridge’s trust account of approximately $72.5 million. upon the closing, the company’s units ceased trading, and the company’s common stock and warrants began trading on the nasdaq stock market under the symbols “rpay” and “rpayw,” respectively. 9 the per share redemption price of approximately $10.33 for holders of public shares electing redemption was paid out of thunder bridge’s trust account, which after taking into account the aggregate payment in respect of the redemption, had a balance immediately prior to the closing of approximately $194.0 million. such balance in the trust account, together with approximately $70.6 million in net proceeds from the debt financing pursuant to the credit agreement and $135.0 million in proceeds from the pipe financing (as defined below), were used to pay transaction expenses, the payment of $50.0 million to repay for general corporate purposes (including to fund future acquisitions and pay down debt) the payment to the warrant holders in connection with the warrant amendment as described below, certain transaction bonuses and other payments to repay employees, and the cash component of the merger consideration of approximately $260.8 million. form 10 information item 2.01(f) of form 8-k states that if the predecessor registrant was a shell company, as thunder bridge was immediately before the business combination, then the registrant must disclose the information that would be required if the registrant were filing a general form for registration of securities on form 10. accordingly, the company, as the successor issuer to thunder bridge, is providing the information below that would be included in a form 10 if the company were to file a form 10. please note that the information provided below relates to the company as the combined company after the consummation of the business combination, unless otherwise specifically indicated or the context otherwise requires. forward-looking statements this current report on form 8-k contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services; and other statements identified by words such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “outlook” or words of similar meaning. these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the company’s industry and market sizes, future opportunities for the company and the company’s estimated future results. such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. in addition to factors previously disclosed in prior reports filed with the sec, including the proxy statement/prospectus and those identified elsewhere in this current report on form 8-k, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: a delay or failure to realize the expected benefits from the business combination; changes in the payment processing market in which the company competes, including with respect to its competitive landscape, technology evolution or regulatory changes; changes in the vertical markets that the company targets; risks relating to the company’s relationships within the payment ecosystem; risk that the company may not be able to execute its growth strategies, including identifying and executing acquisitions; risks relating to data security; changes in accounting policies applicable to the company; and the risk that the company may not be able to develop and maintain effective internal controls. 10 actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements are based. there can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties

reflect actual results. business the business of the company is described in the proxy statement/prospectus in the section titled “information about repay” and that information is incorporated herein by reference. risk factors the risks associated with the company are described in the proxy statement/prospectus in the section titled “risk factors,” which is incorporated herein by reference. in addition, the following risk factors have been updated since the filing of the proxy statement/prospectus. the company’s level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to meet its obligations under its indebtedness, react to changes in the economy or its industry and to raise additional capital to fund operations. in connection with the business combination, repay entered into the $230.0 million credit agreement with suntrust bank and certain other lenders. as of the closing, approximately $170 million of aggregate principal amount is outstanding under the credit agreement, and such level of indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders of the company. for example, such level of indebtedness could: ●make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to any indebtedness, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such indebtedness; ●increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business; ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business; ●limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise; and ●place us at a potential competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject it to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. 11 future operating flexibility is limited in significant respects by the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement, and we may be unable to comply with all covenants in the future. the credit agreement imposes restrictions that could impede our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions, as well as increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business and industry. these restrictions will limit our ability to, among other things: ●incur or guarantee additional debt; ●pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any capital stock; ●make certain payments, dividends, distributions or investments; and ●merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets, other than with respect to the business combination. in addition, the credit agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict the incurrence of indebtedness unless certain incurrence-based financial covenant requirements are met. the restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interests of the business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants in future periods will largely depend on our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default, which could result in the acceleration of our debt. in the event of an acceleration of our indebtedness, we could be forced to apply all available cash flows to repay such debt, which would reduce or eliminate distributions to us, which could also force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. financial information reference is made to the disclosure set forth in item 9.01 of this current report on form 8-k concerning the financial information of the company. reference is further made to the disclosure contained in the proxy

class of the company’s common stock; ●each named executive officer or director of the company; and ●all officers and directors of the company as a group. beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the sec, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he, she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days. 12 the beneficial ownership of shares of the company’s common stock immediately following completion of the business combination is based on the following: (i) an aggregate of 36,395,259 ordinary shares of thunder bridge (including 4,115,000 founder shares and 13,500,000 class a ordinary shares issued in connection with the pipe financing) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the business combination which shares converted into shares of class a common stock of the company upon

2,335,000 founder shares at closing (see the disclosure in the proxy statement/prospectus in the section titled “shareholder proposal 2: the business combination proposal—related agreements—sponsor letter agreement”), and (ii) approximately 100 shares of class v common stock issued upon the completion of the business combination, with each repay equity holder receiving one share of class v common stock together with pro rata number of post-merger repay units and assuming no such post-merger repay units received as merger consideration are exchanged for class a common stock until the six month anniversary of the closing; provided that, the information below (a) does not give effect to any shares issuable upon vesting of the earn-out units, (b) assumes that the escrow units are held by repay equity holders and not cancelled and returned to the company and that no additional post-merger repay units are issued in connection with the post-closing purchase price adjustment pursuant to the merger agreement, (c) assumes that the 2,965,000 shares of class a common stock held by the sponsor in escrow are not forfeited, (d) assumes that no warrants are exercised, except that the pipe investors that are warrant holders exercise their respective private placement warrants pursuant to the terms thereof, solely for purposes of calculating each such pipe investors’ respective voting power post-business combination, and (e) gives effect to restricted class a common stock grants (subject to performance or time vesting, as the case may be) in the aggregate of 2,198,025 to executive officers after the closing but otherwise assumes that there are no other issuance of equity securities in connection with the closing, including any other equity awards that may be issued under the

next to the caption “minimum cash consideration condition” erroneously stated “requires that holders of not more than 13,568,628 of thunder bridge’s class a ordinary shares (52.6% of the outstanding thunder bridge class a ordinary shares) elect to have their shares redeemed.” this statement should read “requires that holders of not more than 12,215,084 of thunder bridge’s class a ordinary shares (47.3% of the outstanding thunder bridge class a ordinary shares) elect to have their shares redeemed.” there are no changes to the selected investor presentation slides other than these corrective changes to slide 3 and all other content and information contained in the initial 8-k filing remains the same as that which was contained in the initial 8-k filing. this amendment supersedes in its entirety the initial 8-k filing with respect to the selected investor presentation slides only. a copy of the corrected selected investor presentation slides is attached as exhibit 99.3. the

and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 1 in addition to factors previously disclosed in thunder bridge’s reports filed with the sec and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: inability to meet the closing conditions to the business combination, including the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of thunder bridge’s shareholders and warrantholders, the

operations due to the proposed transaction; changes in the payment processing market in which repay competes, including with respect to its competitive landscape, technology evolution or regulatory

which those forward-looking statements are based. there can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. all information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof in the case of information about thunder bridge and repay or the date of such information in the case of information from persons other than thunder bridge or repay, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this communication. forecasts and estimates regarding repay’s industry and end markets are based on sources we believe to be reliable, however there can be no assurance these forecasts and estimates will prove accurate in whole or in part. annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results. no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k/a shall not constitute a solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization

company, as warrant agent (the “warrant agent”). pursuant to the warrant amendment, the warrant agreement will be amended to provide, that: ●each of the warrants (the “warrants”) to purchase thunder bridge class a ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the closing, including the warrants issued in thunder bridge’s initial public offering (the “public warrants”) and the warrants initially issued to the sponsor and cantor in a private placement (the “private warrants”), will become exercisable for one-quarter of one class a ordinary share of thunder bridge, rather than a whole class a ordinary share, at an exercise price of $2.875 per one-quarter share ($11.50 per whole share); ●each holder of the warrants will receive, for each such warrant (in exchange for the reduction in the number of shares for which such warrants are exercisable), $1.50 in cash (the “warrant cash payment”); and ●the private warrants will be redeemable and exercisable on the same basis as the public warrants. the holders of the private warrants have waived their rights to receive the warrant cash payment. in connection with the transactions, the warrants will be converted automatically in the domestication into the right to acquire the number of shares of common stock of repay holdings corporation (thunder bridge, as renamed following the domestication) as would have been issuable if the holder of such warrants had exercised the warrants immediately prior to the domestication (in each case, after giving effect to the warrant amendment). the warrant amendment requires the approval of holders of at least 65% of the outstanding public warrants to become effective. thunder bridge will call a meeting (the “warrantholder meeting”) of the holders of the outstanding warrants (“warrantholders”) (to be held immediately prior to the special meeting of holders of thunder bridge ordinary shares to be called to consider and vote upon the matters relating to the transactions) to approve the warrant amendment. the foregoing description of the warrant amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the warrant amendment, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 10.2 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. 3 support agreement in connection with the second amendment providing that richard thornburgh will serve on the board of directors of thunder bridge immediately after the closing in lieu of james kirk, mr. thornburgh has entered into a support agreement (the “support agreement”) in favor of thunder bridge and repay and their present and future successors and subsidiaries (collectively, the “covered parties”). in the support agreement, mr. thornburgh has agreed for the restricted period described below, subject to specified exceptions and conditions in the support agreement, to not directly or indirectly engage or invest in, own, manage, operate, finance, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation, financing or control of, or be employed by, any business that is primarily engaged in the business of providing electronic payment processing services to merchants in any or all of the payday lending, installment lending, buy-here, pay-here auto lending, collections, debt recovery and accounts receivable management industries. mr. thornburgh also agreed in the support agreement to certain non-solicitation and non-interference obligations during the restricted period and customary confidentiality requirements. the restricted period lasts from the closing until (x) the six-month anniversary of when mr. thornburgh is no longer an employee or director of the covered parties, or (y) the three-month anniversary of the date mr. thornburgh is no longer an employee or director of the covered parties because mr. thornburgh ceases to be affiliated with corsair. in addition, thunder bridge and repay have agreed to terminate the support agreement that they previously entered into with mr. kirk on january 21, 2019. the foregoing description of the support agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the support agreement, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 10.3 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. the disclosure set forth in item 3.02 below is incorporated herein by reference. item 3.02unregistered sale of equity securities. on may 9, 2019, thunder bridge entered into subscription agreements (each, a “subscription agreement”) with the investors named therein (the “pipe investors”), pursuant to which thunder bridge agreed to issue and sell to the pipe investors an aggregate of one hundred thirty-five million dollars ($135,000,000) of thunder bridge class a ordinary shares, at a price of $10.00 per class a ordinary share, simultaneously with or immediately prior to the closing (the “pipe investment”). the pipe investment is conditioned on the closing being scheduled to occur concurrently or immediately following the closing of the pipe investment and other customary closing conditions. the proceeds from the pipe investment will be used to fund a portion of the required cash consideration payable to the company equity holders, the warrant cash payment payable to the warrantholders in connection with the warrant amendment and other payments required in connection with the transactions. excess proceeds will be paid by thunder bridge to repay as the company balance sheet allocation pursuant to the merger agreement and will be available for corporate purposes including paying indebtedness or funding future acquisitions. in the event those excess proceeds together with other cash available in connection with the transactions exceed $60 million, the excess over such amount will increase the portion of the merger consideration to be paid to the company equity holders in cash (with a corresponding decrease of the amount to be paid to the company equity holders in units of repay). 4 thunder bridge has agreed in the subscription agreements to file a registration statement covering the shares purchased by the pipe investors within 15 business days after the closing of the pipe investment and to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the registration statement effective until the earlier of two years following the closing of the pipe investment and the first day on which the pipe investors can sell all of their shares under rule 144 without manner of sale or volume restrictions. the foregoing obligations are subject to delay or suspension by thunder bridge for customary limited periods. in connection with the pipe investment, on may 9, 2019, certain pipe investors entered into a letter agreement by and among thunder bridge, the sponsor and the pipe investors named therein (the “lock-up agreement”). pursuant to the lock-up agreement, the pipe investors party thereto agreed, for a period commencing on the closing and ending one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter, not to engage in a prohibited transfer (as defined in the lock-up agreement (which generally includes all sales, lending and other transfer arrangements, subject to specified exceptions)) with respect to the thunder bridge shares acquired by such pipe investor pursuant to the subscription agreement and the private warrants (and any shares issuable upon exercise of such private warrants) acquired by such pipe investor from the sponsor pursuant to the lock-up agreement. in consideration for entering into the lock-up agreement, the sponsor agreed to transfer to the pipe investors party to the lock-up agreement an aggregate of 8,000,000 private warrants held by the sponsor. the private warrants to be transferred pursuant to the lock-up agreement will be subject to the terms of the warrant amendment such that following such amendment they will be exercisable for an aggregate of 2,000,000 class a ordinary shares. the foregoing descriptions of the subscription agreement and lock-up agreement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the forms of subscription agreement and lock-up agreement, respectively, copies of which are filed as exhibit 10.4 and exhibit 10.5 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. item 7.01. regulation fd disclosure. on may 9, 2019, thunder bridge issued a press release announcing the execution of the second amendment, the subscription agreements and the lock-up agreement. the press release is attached hereto as exhibit 99.1. furnished as exhibit 99.2 is a copy of selected slides that update certain information previously provided in the investor presentation dated april 2019 and furnished as exhibit 99.1 to the form 8-k filed on april 2, 2019 by thunder bridge. the information in this item 7.01 and exhibit 99.1 and exhibit 99.2 attached hereto shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of section 18 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the “exchange act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the securities act of 1933, as amended (“securities act”) or the exchange act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. item 8.01. other events. in connection with the transactions, thunder bridge anticipates presenting its unaudited pro forma combined financial information as of and for the year ended december 31, 2018 (“pro forma information”) as follows: (1) a scenario that assumes no class a ordinary shares of thunder bridge are redeemed (“no redemption”), in which the proposed business combination is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting on the basis of thunder bridge being the accounting acquirer and (2) a scenario that assumes the maximum number of class a ordinary shares of thunder bridge that can be redeemed, while still satisfying the closing conditions under the merger agreement, are redeemed (without any additional equity financing taking place other than the pipe investment)(“maximum redemptions”), in which the proposed business combination is accounted for as a reverse merger on the basis of repay being the accounting acquirer. such pro forma information will be presented in an amendment filing of thunder bridge’s registration statement on form s-4 (the “form s-4”), together with accompanying notes to such pro forma information that describe the assumptions and estimates underlying the applicable pro forma adjustments. in the pro forma information relating to the no redemption scenario, acquisition accounting would be applied to repay’s historical balance sheet information by recording fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. in addition, as a result of the transaction terms described in item 1.01 of this current report on form 8-k and based on the assumptions and estimates to be described in the form s-4, we expect that, as of december 31, 2018, (i) cash and cash equivalents on a combined pro forma basis would have been approximately $60 million (which now reflects, among other things, the impact of the reduced required cash consideration, proceeds of the pipe investment, the aggregate warrant cash payment and the increased portion of the merger consideration that may be paid in cash to repay equity holders), (ii) goodwill on a combined pro forma basis would have been between approximately $380 million and $415 million (which now reflects, among other things, the impact of the reduced base merger consideration), (iii) additional paid-in capital would have been between approximately $370 million and $405 million (which now reflects, among other things, the impact of the proceeds from the pipe investment and the aggregate warrant cash payment) and (iv) equity attributable to non controlling interests would have been approximately $151 million (which now reflects, among other things, the fair value of the post-merger repay units that the repay shareholders will receive). in the pro forma information relating to the maximum redemption scenario, repay’s historical basis would be carried over in a reverse merger. under such scenario, among other differences from the no redemption scenario, (i) the estimated liabilities relating to the tax receivable agreement would be recorded as a dividend as opposed to contingent consideration, (ii) there would be no fair value adjustments in respect of intangible assets and goodwill and (iii) the estimated liabilities relating to the tax receivable agreement would increase primarily due to undiscounted liability being recorded. unaudited pro forma combined financial information is derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the financial information of thunder bridge and repay contained in the form s-4. unaudited pro forma combined financial information is for illustrative purposes only. you should not rely on unaudited pro forma financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the transactions occurred on the date indicated or the future results that thunder bridge or repay or the surviving company will experience. actual results may differ materially from the assumptions used to present unaudited pro forma combined financial statements. the descriptions of the selected pro forma information above are preliminary and may be updated. in particular, the final merger consideration and the cash and equity consideration components thereof are subject to settlement of certain closing adjustment items, and all estimates of pro forma adjustments described above are based on currently available information and assumptions, which may change and be updated. for example, the components that comprise the cash consideration have fluctuated since december 31, 2018 and are expected to continue to do so. furthermore, such selected pro forma information should not be viewed as substitute for full unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information prepared in accordance with regulation s-x, which will be presented in the form s-4 of thunder bridge. you should refer to such form s-4 when it becomes available which will also describe the assumptions and estimates underlying the applicable pro forma adjustments that were used to prepare the selected pro forma information above, as well as the full unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in such form s-4. 5 important information about the transaction and where to find it this communication is being made in respect of the proposed business combination between thunder bridge and repay. in connection with the proposed business combination, thunder bridge has filed with the securities and exchange commission (“sec”) a registration statement on form s-4, which includes a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus of thunder bridge, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the sec. after the registration statement is declared effective, thunder bridge will mail the definitive proxy statement/prospectus to its

available, the definitive proxy statement/prospectus and any other relevant documents filed with the sec, as well as any amendments or supplements to these documents, because they will contain
