statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding projections, estimates and forecasts of revenue and other financial and performance metrics and projections of market opportunity and expectations, and the closing of the proposed transaction. these statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of dd3 and betterware management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of dd3 and betterware. these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in betterware’s clients’ preferences, prospects and the competitive conditions prevailing in the industries in which betterware operates; the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the proposed

incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither dd3 nor betterware presently know or that dd3 and betterware currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect dd3’s and betterware’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this current report on form 8-k. dd3 and betterware anticipate that subsequent events and
