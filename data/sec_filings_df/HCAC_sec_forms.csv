meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the united states private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential benefits of the transactions and the potential success of the company's go-to-market strategy, and expectations related to the terms and timing of the transactions. these statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this report, and on the current expectations of the company’s and hcac’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of the company and hcac. these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the transactions, including the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the transactions or that the approval of the stockholders of hcac or the company is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions; risks relating to the uncertainty of the projected financial information with respect to the company; risks related to the rollout of the company’s business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; risks related to future market adoption of the company's offerings; risks related to the company's go-to-market strategy and subscription business model; the effects of competition on the company’s future business; the amount of redemption requests made by hcac’s public stockholders; the ability of hcac or the combined company to issue equity or equity-linked securities in connection with the transactions or in the future, and those factors discussed in hcac’s final prospectus filed on march 4, 2019, annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 and quarterly reports on form 10-q for the quarters ended march 31, 2020 and june 30, 2020, in each case, under the heading “risk factors,” and other documents of hcac filed, or to be filed, with the sec. if any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither hcac nor the company presently know or that hcac and the company currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect hcac’s and the company’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this report. hcac and the company anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause hcac’s and the company’s assessments to change. however, while hcac and the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, hcac and the company specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing hcac’s and the company’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this report. accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. 9 item 9.01 financial statements and
