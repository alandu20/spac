historical facts nor assurances of future performance. instead, they are based only on management’s current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding our ability to close the cpa global transaction and to obtain permanent debt financing in connection therewith, and to realize the expected synergies of the combination transaction, as well as the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy, and other future conditions. because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are difficult to predict and many

or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. forward-looking statements are based only on information currently available to our management and speak only as of the date of this report. we do not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 1information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws. please consult our public filings with the sec or our website at www.clarivate.com.item
