arrangement agreement), and amendment no. 3 to arrangement agreement dated june 1, 2020 (“amendment no. 3 to arrangement agreement”) (the “arrangement agreement”), among the company, akerna canada ample exchange inc., a corporation incorporated under the business corporations act (ontario) (the “obca”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company (the “purchaser”), and ample organics inc., a corporation incorporated under the obca (“ample”), pursuant to which the company through the purchaser agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity of ample (the “arrangement”). on july 7, 2020 (the “closing date”), the arrangement was consummated by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under ontario law (the “plan of arrangement”) and ample became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. pursuant to the arrangement agreement and the plan of arrangement, on the closing date, holders of ample common shares and class a preferred shares (collectively, the “ample shares”) received a number of redeemable preferred shares of the purchaser (the “exchangeable shares”) equal to the number of ample shares multiplied by the exchange ratio of 0.0524 (the “exchange ratio”). in the aggregate, ample shareholders received 3,294,574 exchangeable shares. the exchange ratio was agreed to on december 18, 2019, and was not adjusted for any subsequent changes in market price of the company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “akerna shares”) or the ample shares prior to the closing date. the exchangeable shares are exchangeable for akerna shares on a 1:1 basis, as determined in accordance with the arrangement agreement. based on the closing price of the akerna shares on the closing date, the consideration received by ample shareholders in the aggregate had a value of approximately $30.7 million. of the 3,294,574 exchangeable shares that were issued to former ample shareholders in connection with the consummation of the arrangement, an aggregate of 658,915 exchangeable shares were issued as “closing consideration” and an aggregate of 2,635,659 exchangeable shares, constituting part of the “escrowed consideration” were issued into escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement (the “escrow agreement”), entered into on july 7, 2020 by and among the company, purchaser, john prentice, as shareholder representative, and odyssey trust company. under the escrow agreement, subject to unresolved claims by the company under the arrangement agreement in respect of fraud, the escrowed consideration shall be released to former ample shareholders upon the six-, nine-, and twelve-month anniversaries of the closing date in accordance with the following schedule - 988,372 shares on the six-month anniversary, 823,643 shares on the nine-month anniversary, and 823,644 shares on the twelve-month anniversary. in addition to the exchangeable shares, each ample shareholder, upon the arrangement becoming effective on the closing date (the “closing time”), received one contingent value right (each a “cvr” and collectively the “cvrs”). each cvr entitles the holder to receive a portion of deferred consideration (as defined in the arrangement agreement) that the initial holder of such cvr was entitled to receive in its capacity as an ample shareholder, with an aggregate of up to cad$10,000,000 additional exchangeable shares issuable to the holders of the cvrs subject to downward adjustment pursuant to the arrangement agreement. pursuant to the rights indenture entered into on july 7, 2020 by and among the company, purchaser, john prentice, as shareholder representative, and odyssey trust company (the “rights indenture”), holders of cvrs are entitled to additional exchangeable shares if certain revenue targets are achieved by ample during the twelve-month period following the closing date. ample’s shareholders adopted and approved the arrangement agreement and the plan of arrangement on june 26, 2020. the company’s shareholders approved the issuance of the akerna shares (including the akerna shares issuable upon exchange of the exchangeable shares, including upon exchange of additional exchangeable

exchange trust agreement”) with the purchaser, callco, and odyssey trust company (the “trustee”) solely for the purpose of ensuring that each exchangeable share is substantially the economic and voting equivalent of an akerna share, and, following the registration of the akerna shares issuable upon exchange of the exchangeable shares under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the “securities act”), ensuring that each exchangeable share is exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for an akerna share, subject to certain limitations set forth therein. together, the voting and exchange trust agreement and the exchangeable share support agreement set forth the terms governing the exchangeable shares. through the voting and exchange trust agreement and the issuance by the company to the trustee of a special voting share (the “special voting share”), each holder of exchangeable shares effectively has the ability to cast votes along with holders of akerna shares, as described below under item 3.03 of this current report on form 8-k. in addition, the voting and exchange trust agreement grants exchange rights upon an event of insolvency of the purchaser, or the liquidation,

all such exchangeable shares for akerna shares pursuant to their terms, will represent approximately 20.3% of the total number of issued and outstanding akerna shares. in connection with the completion of the arrangement and the creation and issuance of the exchangeable shares by purchaser, as described above under item 2.01 of this current report on form 8-k, the company filed a certificate of designation for the special voting share with the secretary of state of the state of delaware on june 26, 2020 to create the special voting share that was issued to the trustee. the special voting share has a par value of $0.0001 per share. the special voting share entitles the holder thereof to an aggregate number of votes equal to the number of the exchangeable shares issued and outstanding from time to time and which are not owned by the company or its subsidiaries. except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holder of the special voting share and the holders of akerna shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the company’s shareholders. with respect to all meetings of shareholders of the company at which holders of

“expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predicts,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. forward-looking statements in this current report include, but are not limited to, statements about: ●the market for akerna’s products and services; ●akerna’s expansion and other plans and opportunities; ●akerna’s inability to realize anticipated benefits of the business combination, which could result from, among other things, competition, the inability to integrate the mtech and mjf businesses or the inability of the combined business to grow and manage growth profitably; and ●changes in applicable laws or regulations. these forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this current report, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing akerna’s views as of any subsequent date, and akerna does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under

december 31 to a fiscal year ending june 30 for its fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 and thereafter. business overview mjf, is a large and growing regulatory compliance and inventory management technology company. mjf’s proprietary software platform is adaptable for industries in which interfacing with government regulatory agencies for compliance purposes is required, or where the tracking of organic materials from seed or plant to end products is desired. nine years ago, mjf identified a need for organic material tracking and regulatory compliance saas solutions in the growing cannabis, hemp, and other regulated organic industries. mjf developed products intended to assist states in monitoring licensed businesses’ compliance with state regulations, and to help state-licensed businesses operate in compliance with such law. mjf provides its regulatory software platform, leaf data systems®, to state government regulatory agencies, and its business software platform, mj platform®, to state-licensed businesses. although mjf has helped monitor legal compliance for more than $13 billion in cannabis sales to date, it does not handle any cannabis related material, does not process sales transactions within the united states, and its revenue generation is not related to the type or amount of sales made by its clients, as revenues are generated by mjf on a fixed-fee based subscription model. 7 mjf’s annual revenues have grown each year since inception, from $0.8 million in its first full year of operations in the fiscal year ended december 31, 2010 to $5.6 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 to $10.5 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018. the growth in fiscal year ending june 30, 2018, was primarily due to the government contracts awarded by the state of washington and the commonwealth of pennsylvania. prior to june 30, 2018, the growth was mainly attributed to mjf’s strong presence as a first-mover in an expanding cannabis market. the company believes its service offerings are built to scale nationally and internationally while providing technology compliance, monitoring and auditing products across the entire supply chain and all industry verticals of the cannabis, cbd and hemp markets. importantly, the company has already started serving businesses and governments globally. mjf currently has clients in 29 of the 33 states in which medicinal cannabis has been legalized, as well as the district of columbia. new york and illinois are the only states in which medicinal marijuana has been legalized in which mjf does not provide products or services. mjf also serves clients in australia, canada, chile, colombia, denmark, new zealand, south africa, spain, switzerland and uruguay. we believe these factors establish the company as a mature, vetted solution for the coming global expansion in the industry. the company expects to leverage its first-mover advantage and reputation among industry participants throughout the global supply chain to increase market share, including in growth markets, such as the emerging asian markets. according to an article in the economist on april 4, 2019, china grows nearly half of the world’s legal hemp. with the help of the company’s investors, such as khitan, llc, of which emery huang, a director of the company, and michael di hao zhang, son of the former chairman of guizhou xinbang pharmaceuticals, are members, the company will look to make inroads into the chinese market. products and services mjf’s core products, leaf data systems and mj platform, are highly-versatile platforms that provide mjf’s clients with a central data management system for tracking regulated products – from seed to initial plant growth to product – throughout the complete supply chain, using a global unique identifier method. mjf’s platforms also provide clients with integrated security, transparency and scalability capabilities. these capabilities allow mjf’s state-licensed clients to control inventory, operate efficiently in a fast-changing industry and comply with state, local, and federal (in countries such as canada and colombia) regulation at all times, and allows its government regulatory clients to effectively and cost-efficiently monitor licensees and ensure that commercial businesses are complying with their states’ regulations. mjf generates revenue in three principal areas: ● government regulatory software – leaf data systems is mjf’s saas offering for government agencies. leaf data systems is a compliance tracking system designed to give regulators visibility into the activity of licensed cannabis businesses in their jurisdictions. mjf currently has two clients for leaf data systems, the state of washington and the commonwealth of pennsylvania. leaf data systems comprised 46% and 44% of mjf’s revenue for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. for the full fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017, leaf data systems comprised 43% and 4% of mjf’s total revenue, respectively. the 2018 growth was a result of winning government contracts in the state of pennsylvania and washington. ● commercial software – mj platform is mjf’s saas offering for state-licensed businesses. mj platform is an erp (“enterprise resource planning”) compliance system specific to the cannabis, hemp and cannabidiol (“cbd”) industry. mj platform is comprised of integrated modules designed to meet the regulations and inventory management needs of cannabis and hemp cbd cultivators, manufacturers and retailers. mjf has meaningful market share for cannabis-centric enterprise software in most regulated u.s. state markets, with market share in each state ranging from 6% to 100% based on marijuana business media’s latest fact book, state tax agencies’ records, and locator services. mj platform comprised 40% and 33% of mjf’s revenue for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively. for the full fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017, commercial software comprised 35% and 52% of mjf’s total revenue, respectively. fiscal year 2018 noted increased growth as a result of the release of the second-generation erp product, mj platform, gaining traction in the marketplace and the general expansion of the cannabis, hemp and cbd markets. 8 ● consulting services – mjf’s consulting team provides a complete suite of consulting services to banks, investors, businesses, and governments interested in the cannabis, hemp, and cbd industry. the offerings center on legal compliance, compliance monitoring systems, legal application processes and inspection readiness and business reviews. consulting comprised 11% and 21% of mjf’s revenue for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. for the full fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017, consulting services comprised 22% and 38% of mjf’s total revenue, respectively. revenue derived from mjf’s consulting activities has been dependent on emerging market activity. as a result, to date, the months in which mjf recognizes consulting revenue has varied from year to year depending on whether legalization has expanded, and new market entrants have appeared, or existing market participants have expanded their operations. for example, while consulting revenue appears to have slowed during the nine months ended march 31, 2019, it is expected to increase during the three months ending june 30, 2019, due to emerging opportunities in missouri, utah, new jersey, and arkansas as these states have experienced recent state legal changes. further, mjf has had numerous clients granted their operator’s license in the state of ohio and has submitted several applications on behalf of clients in maryland and missouri that are currently pending state review. mjf also resells a limited number of printers for printing compliance product labels and scales that are ntep certified legal for trade. revenue from these resale activities was approximately 3% of total revenue in the nine months ended march 31, 2019, and 1% of total revenue in the nine months ended march 31, 2018. resale activities comprised 1% of total revenue in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 and 6% of total revenue in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. this income stream is not expected to become a significant generator of revenue. financial results of operations revenue mjf’s software revenue is derived from mj platform, the company’s saas erp offering for state-licensed businesses, and leaf data systems, mjf’s track-and-trace product for government agencies. mj platform contracts are generally annual contracts paid monthly in advance of service and cancellable upon 30 days’ notice, although mjf does have some multi-year mj platform contracts. leaf data systems contracts are generally multi-year contracts payable annually or quarterly in advance of service, although a percentage retainer or holdback fees (generally ranging from 10% to 30%) are common until all initial deliverables are complete. mj platform and leaf data systems contracts generally may only be terminated early for breach of contract as defined in the respective agreements. leaf data systems’ contract with the commonwealth of pennsylvania is covered under a performance bond. mjf’s consulting revenue is derived throughout the life cycle of a customer. mjf’s other revenue is derived primarily from point of sale hardware and labels. commercial software revenue growth is driven by mjf leveraging its reputation and continued cannabis, hemp and cbd industry growth. mjf believes it is well known in these industries and can leverage its reputation, brand recognition, and wealth of relevant experience to attract existing cultivation, manufacturing and dispensary customers from their current service providers, and attract new market entrants. mjf believes that the reputation of its existing products and its ability to provide services in all areas of the seed to sale life cycle will attract customers from competitors that are seeking more comprehensive services and will attract new customers as they enter into existing markets and markets that become newly legalized. mjf also experiences revenue growth in mature, established states and countries by providing a solution to operators seeking to vertically integrate their operations and improve their operations. mjf provides not only a vertically integrated solution across the cannabis, hemp, and cbd supply chain, but also uniquely has the business intelligence capture which allows operators to run their businesses in a more informed and efficient manner. this business intelligence capture is unique to the suite of services provided by mjf and sets mjf apart from competitors. 9 consulting services revenue growth is driven by numerous factors. in new emerging states, mjf provides proven solutions for aspiring operators in the pre-application of licensures and pre-operational phases of development. these services include application and business plan preparation as they seek licenses to be granted. consulting services are provided to post operational licensees to consult them during the setup and buildout phases as they open and begin operating their businesses. mjf also provides business optimization services for established businesses that can benefit from consulting to increase efficiencies as they expand and grow. mjf’s contracts its consulting services through statements of work (sow) for businesses, investors, and governments interested in the cannabis, hemp and cbd industry. sow issued and completed during the pre-application phase generally solidify mjf as the contractor of choice for subsequent operational phases once the operator is granted the license. as a result, mjf consulting revenue is driven as new emerging states pass legislation and as its client-operators gain licenses. during the second half of mjf’s fiscal year 2019, mjf has had numerous clients granted their operator’s license in the state of ohio and has submitted numerous applications on behalf of clients in maryland and missouri that are currently pending state review. mjf expects to win additional work in the emerging states of missouri, utah, new jersey, and arkansas as mjf has strong industry reputation in those states. accordingly, mjf expects its consulting services to continue to grow. cost of revenue mjf’s cost of revenue is derived from direct costs derived primarily from government contract subcontractor expenses and hosting costs. mjf records cost of revenue based on the direct cost method. this method requires allocation of direct costs including support services and materials to cost of revenue. consulting cost of revenue is primarily determined as a result of the consultant’s hourly costs. product and development expenses mjf's product and development expenses include salaries and benefits, nearshore contractor expenses, technology expenses, and other overhead. these expenses have grown over time, and mjf expects these expenses to continue to increase with the company’s growth. selling, general and administrative expenses mjf’s selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits, public relations and investor relations fees, outage expenses, professional fees, and other overhead. these expenses have grown over time, and mjf expects these expenses to continue to increase with the company’s growth. 10 results of operations for the

net loss for the three and nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, consolidating the results of commercial software and government software: three months ended march 31, 2019 2018 revenues:

from $2,315,635 for the three months ended march 31, 2018, an increase of $12,245. total revenue decreased to approximately $7,297,859 million for the nine months ended march 31, 2019, from $7,847,719 for the nine months ended march 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately $549,860, or 7%. this decline is primarily due to a decreased volume of activities related to both the contract with the state of washington and mjf’s consulting services clients due to the variable nature of the business model discussed above. the year-over-year decrease in revenue for the nine-month period ended march 31, 2019 was, however, partially offset by an increase in revenue from software subscriptions. leaf data systems revenue from the contract with the state of washington decreased for the three months ended march 31, 2019 as a result of a higher volume of change orders in the prior year period. change orders represent out-of-scope functionality modifications requested by the client. revenues earned from these change orders are recognized upon successful implementation and delivery of the requested modifications. as a result, revenues from these clients when compared year over year may be impacted by the timing of the agreement relative to the number of requested change orders in one or either period. leaf data systems revenue from the contract with the state of washington increased for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 as a result of a significant volume of change orders in the first quarter of mjf’s fiscal year 2019. revenue from the leaf data systems contract with the commonwealth of pennsylvania decreased for both the three and nine-month periods ended march 31, 2019, which was driven by a lower volume of completed change orders. mjf’s software revenue decreased to $2,024,916 for the three months ended march 31, 2019 from $2,053,258 for the three months ended march 31, 2018, for a decrease of $28,342, or 1%. this decline in revenue was primarily driven by fewer change orders for both state contracts under leaf data systems during the three-month period ended march 31, 2019. however, software revenue increased to $6,270,770 for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 from $6,087,427 for the nine months ended march 31, 2018, for an increase of $183,343, or 3%. this increase was primarily due to growth in the number of subscriptions to mj platform (mjf’s commercial software product), thus increasing recurring saas revenue, in addition to increases in revenue from leaf data systems contract with the state of washington (both monthly subscription services and change orders delivered over the period). a decline in revenue from the contract with the commonwealth of pennsylvania was driven by fewer change orders but was offset by a high volume of activity under the contract with the state of washington during the nine-months ended march 31, 2019. the company's software revenues generated from government customers under leaf data systems totaled $927,632 and $1,046,417 during the three months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. these software revenues generated from government customers also totaled $3,381,111 and $3,479,380 during the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. software revenue accounted for 87% and 89% of net revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively and 86% and 78% of net revenue for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. mjf’s software recurring revenue includes revenue generated from mjf’s commercial product, mj platform, and mjf’s regulatory systems product, leaf data systems and seed-to-sale implementation fees for mj platform. 12 consulting revenue mjf’s consulting revenue includes revenue generated from consulting professional services delivered to prospective and current cannabis, hemp and cbd businesses and business operators. mjf’s consulting revenue was $216,897 for the three months ended march 31, 2019 compared to $224,802 for the three months ended march 31, 2018, for a decrease of $7,905, or 4%, as a result of a smaller volume of consulting activities and engagements. consulting services are correlated to state legalizations and experience variability as a result. mjf’s consulting revenue was $826,777 for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 compared to $1,646,392 for the nine months ended march 31, 2018, for a decrease of $819,615, or 50%. consulting revenue was 9% and 10% of net revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. consulting revenue was 11% and 21% of net revenue for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. due to the nature of consulting revenue and its dependence on emerging market activity as a driver of demand, the months in which mjf recognizes consulting revenue has varied from year to year depending on whether state legislation has expanded to allow new market entrants or growth of existing market participant operations. for example, while consulting revenue appears to have slowed during the nine months ended march 31, 2019, it is expected to increase during the three months ending june 30, 2019, due to emerging opportunities in missouri, utah, new jersey, and arkansas as these states have experienced recent state legal changes. further, 5 of mjf’s clients in ohio have recently won processing licenses. other revenue mjf’s retail/resale revenue increased to $86,067 for the three months ended march 31, 2019 from $37,575 for the three months ended march 31, 2018, for an increase of $48,492, or 129%. mjf’s retail/resale revenue increased to $200,312 for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 from $113,900 for the nine months ended march 31, 2018, for an increase of $86,412, or 76%. retail/resale revenue was 4% and 2% of net revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. retail/resale revenue was 3% and 1% of net revenue for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. mjf’s retail/resale revenue includes revenue generated from point of sale hardware and labels. cost of revenue mjf’s cost of revenue increased to $1,042,403 for the three months ended march 31, 2019 from $737,762 for the three months ended march 31, 2018, for an increase of $304,641, or 41%. the increase over the three month period resulted primarily from higher hosting and infrastructure costs incurred from amazon web services and higher integration costs incurred from oracle for both the leaf data systems and mj platform products. for the nine-month period ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, mjf’s cost of revenue decreased to $3,197,437 from $3,338,478, for a decrease of $141,041, or 4%. this decrease over the nine-month period resulted primarily from a decline in ongoing support and maintenance fees related to leaf data systems because of a smaller volume of services provided in connection with the contracts with the commonwealth of pennsylvania. since the applications and services available through the leaf data system are provided through relationships with third-party service providers at higher costs, the gross profit margins from the government contracts are generally lower. total costs of government revenues incurred by the company, which are included in cost of revenues on the statements of operations, were $493,266 and $420,381 during the three months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. total costs of government revenues incurred by the company were $1,647,530 and $2,307,365 during the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. gross profit margins for the three months ended march 31, 2019 were 55%, compared to 68% for the three months ended march 31, 2018. the decline in gross profit margin for the three months ended march 31, 2019 is due to the higher hosting and infrastructure costs incurred from amazon web services and integration costs from oracle discussed above. gross profit margins for the nine-month period ended march 31, 2019 and 2018 were 56% and 57%, respectively, the decline in margin over the nine-month period was primarily driven by the decline in consulting revenue for the nine-month period, partially offset by revenue growth of mj platform in addition to decreased costs of revenue associated with the contract with the commonwealth of pennsylvania. 13 operating expenses the following table presents operating expense line items for the three and nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018 and the period-over-period dollar and percentage changes for those line items: three months ended march 31, 2019 % of revenue 2018 % of revenue change period over period operating expenses: product development $1,001,394 43% $613,726 27% $387,668 63% selling, general and administrative 2,787,250 120% 590,516 26% 2,196,734 372% total operating expenses $3,788,644 163% $1,204,242 53% $2,584,402 215% the following table presents operating expense line items for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018 and the period-over-period dollar and percentage changes for those line items: nine months ended march 31, 2019 % of revenue 2018 % of revenue change period over period operating expenses: product development $2,877,869 39% $2,109,992 27% $767,877 36% selling, general and administrative 7,793,290 107% 4,903,096 62% 2,890,194 59% total operating expenses $10,671,159 146% $7,013,088 89% $3,658,071 52% mjf’s operating expenses increased to $3,788,644 for the three months ended march 31, 2019 from $1,204,242 for the three months ended march 31, 2018, for an increase of $2,584,402, or 215%. the increased level of operating expenses for the three months ended march 31, 2019 was primarily driven by continued investments in product development. product development expenses increased as mjf enhanced its cybersecurity and enterprise software capabilities following its 2018 security breach. mjf also incurred fewer operating expenses during the three months ended march 31, 2018 as a result of insurance proceeds received from the 2018 security breach. mjf’s operating expenses increased to $10,671,159 for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 from $7,013,088 for the nine months ended march 31, 2018, for an increase of $3,658,071, or 52%. the growth in operating expenses during the nine month period ended march 31, 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in professional fees incurred in preparation for the merger (note 7) in addition to investments in product development as well as sales and marketing. mjf also incurred fewer operating expenses during the nine-months ended march 31, 2018 as a result of insurance proceeds received from the 2018 security breach. 14 liquidity and capital resources cash flows mjf’s cash and restricted cash balance was $6,214,466 and $2,572,401 as of march 31, 2019 and june 30, 2018, respectively. cash flow information for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: nine months ended march 31, 2019 2018 cash provided by (used in): operating activities $(6,357,935) $(3,485,401) financing activities 10,000,000 1,000,000 net increase / (decrease) in cash $3,642,065 $(2,485,401) sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018 net cash used in operating activities increased to $6,357,935 during the nine months ended march 31, 2019, from $3,485,401 during the nine months ended march 31, 2018, for an increase of $2,872,534, or 82%. cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by the net loss of 6,483,489 discussed above during the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018. during the nine months ended march 31, 2019, the net loss was partially offset by efforts to generate cash flow through working capital management. cash used in operations during the nine months ended march 31, 2019, was also impacted by an increase in receivables of $1,491,061. mjf did not have any net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended march 31, 2019 and 2018. net cash provided by financing activities totaled $10,000,000 during the nine months ended march 31, 2019, as a result of amounts raised in mjf’s series c financing. net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1,000,000 during the nine months ended march 31, 2018, as a result of amounts raised in the mjf’s series b financing. liquidity and capital resources as of march 31, 2019, mjf had cash of approximately $5.2 million, excluding restricted cash. mjf had a working capital balance of $4.1 million (excluding restricted cash) as of march 31, 2019 as compared to $0.6 million as of june 30, 2018. since its inception, the company has incurred recurring operating losses, used cash from operations, and relied on capital raising transactions to continue ongoing operations. however, after considering all available evidence, the company has determined that, due to its current positive working capital and the receipt of cash proceeds as a result of the merger and other financing activities discussed below for the net total proceeds of approximately $18 million subsequent to march 31, 2019, no substantial doubt exists in regards to the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date that our march 31, 2019 financial statements were issued. management will continue to evaluate the impact of this standard on the company's financial statements. 15 merger on october 10, 2018 (as amended on april 17, 2019), the company entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “merger agreement”) with mtech

compliance technology company in the cannabis space. the cornerstones of the company’s service offerings are mj platform® and leaf data systems®, which are highly-versatile platforms that provide clients and government entities with a central data management system for tracking regulated cannabis products—from seed to product to shelf to customer—through the complete supply chain. the company believes the growing cannabis industry in numerous u.s. states and other countries outside of the u.s. represents an ideal market for its technology, as states need to ensure legal compliance and the maintenance of the seed-to-sale life cycle within their states, and state-licensed operating companies need to ensure they operate within applicable state law and carefully track inventory. the company’s platforms and related technology offer wide ranging capabilities. the company integrates these capabilities into its software offerings to provide platforms that allow government regulators to engage in accurate and real-time compliance monitoring, and which provide licensed businesses with a true enterprise solution for managing their inventory and compliance. further, the company believes its service offerings are built to scale nationally and internationally while providing technology compliance, monitoring and auditing products across the entire supply chain and all industry verticals of the cannabis, cbd and hemp markets. importantly, the company has already started serving businesses and governments globally. the company currently services clients in 29 of the 33 u.s. states that have legalized cannabis and 11 legalized countries. we believe these factors establish the company as a mature, vetted solution for the coming global expansion in the industry. the company expects to leverage its first-mover advantage and reputation among industry participants throughout the global supply chain to increase market share, including in growth markets, such as the emerging asian markets. according to an article in the economist on april 4, 2019, china grows nearly half of the world’s legal hemp. with the help of the company’s investors, such as khitan, llc, of which emery huang, a director of the company, and michael di hao zhang, son of the former chairman of guizhou xinbang pharmaceuticals, are members, the company will look to make inroads into the chinese market. cautionary note on forward looking statements certain statements made in this current report on form 8-k are “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of
