2019, 8i enterprises acquisition corp. (“jfk”) filed a current report on form 8-k to announce the entry into a share exchange agreement (the “share exchange agreement”) with diginex limited, a hong kong company (“diginex”), the stockholders of diginex (the “sellers”) and pelham limited, a hong kong company, as representative of the sellers (the “representative”). on october 8, 2019, each of the parties to the share exchange agreement entered into an amendment and joinder to the share exchange agreement (the “amendment”) with digital innovative limited, a singapore public company limited by shares (“singapore newco”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary digital innovative limited, a british virgin islands business company (“bvi newco”), for the purpose of joining both entities as parties to the share exchange agreement and amending the terms of the share exchange agreement. on january 28, 2020, each of the parties to the share exchange agreement and amendment entered into a second amendment to the share exchange agreement (the “second amendment”). the share exchange agreement originally provided that diginex may consummate a private placement of its ordinary shares of up to $25 million prior to the date the business combination is consummated (the “closing date”). the size of the private placement was increased to $30 million in the amendment. the purpose of the second amendment is to increase the size of the private placement from $30 million to $50 million. on may 6, 2020, each of the parties to the second amendment entered into a third amendment to the share exchange agreement (the “third amendment,” and together with the share exchange agreement, the amendment and the second amendment, the “third amended share exchange agreement”) to, among other things, (a) extend the outside closing date of the transactions contemplated by the share exchange agreement (the “share exchange”) to june 23, 2020, (b) increase the number of ordinary shares of singapore newco (“singapore newco ordinary shares”) issuable to the sellers in the share exchange from 20,000,000 to 25,000,000, (c) increase the number of shares the sellers are entitled to receive if the closing price of the singapore newco ordinary shares satisfy certain thresholds (the “earnout shares”) from an aggregate of 5,000,000 to 12,000,000, adjust closing price targets and to increase the milestone dates by which the earnout shares could be issued from three years to four years after the anniversary of the closing date; (d) increase the number of options to purchase singapore newco ordinary shares received upon cancellation of the outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares under diginex’s existing incentive plan from 4,200,000 to 5,600,000, and (e) allow jfk to issue up to 1,000,000 singapore newco ordinary shares to third party advisors or consultants to (i) assist jfk with maintaining funds of at least $15,000,000 in the trust account after giving effect to all jfk ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account jfk’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the third amended share exchange agreement, or (ii) provide market making services to diginex after the closing. the third amendment includes new covenants of the parties prior to the closing date, such as (a) jfk shall convert all outstanding promissory notes issued in favor of 8i enterprises pte. ltd. into jfk private units as of the closing date (the “sponsor loan conversion”), (b) jfk shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause chardan capital llc (“chardan”) to agree to convert, effective as of the closing date, deferred underwriting compensation in the amount of $1,725,000 owed to chardan and any additional fees to be paid by jfk to chardan upon the consummation of the closing into singapore newco ordinary shares at $10.00 per share, which shares will be subject to a lock-up agreement restricting any transfer thereof for a period of no less than six months after closing, (c) diginex will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its service providers to enter into a lock-up agreement in connection with receipt of singapore newco ordinary shares that such service provider will receive on the closing date for a period of no less than six months after the closing date, and (d) each of jfk and diginex will use best efforts to assist the other party to fulfill the new covenants relating to (i) jfk maintaining $15,000,000 in the trust account as of the closing date after giving effect to jfk’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account jfk’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the third amended share exchange agreement, and (ii) diginex raising at least $15,000,000 through the issuance of new ordinary shares to be completed no later than the closing (the “subsequent diginex private placement”). the failure to comply with the covenants described in clause (d) of this paragraph will not constitute a material breach of the third amended share exchange agreement for the purposes of fulfilling certain closing conditions of parties, or with respect to the indemnification or termination provisions set forth in the third amended share exchange agreement. in the event the respective covenants that are the subject matter of (d) of this paragraph are not fulfilled, or, (i) if the market value of the unrestricted publicly held jfk ordinary shares (as calculated under the rules of the nasdaq capital market (“nasdaq”)) that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing date (after giving effect to the jfk ordinary share redemptions), and (ii) the combined stockholders equity of jfk and diginex (after giving effect to the jfk ordinary share redemptions, the share exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby), fail to satisfy nasdaq listing requirements ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “nasdaq requirements”), the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with respect thereto. however, if they are unable to reach an agreement, such failure will not be a material breach on the part of any party that elects to terminate the third amended share exchange agreement because the transactions contemplated thereunder did not occur prior to june 23, 2020, the outside closing date. the third amendment includes new covenants of diginex that (a) without jfk’s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), diginex and its affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, or through any other person (including, its directors, officers and agents) engage with or contact, for the purpose of making an investment into diginex or any of its affiliates, any potential investor actually introduced to diginex or its affiliates by jfk or its affiliates during the period commencing on april 27, 2020 and ending on the earlier of the closing date and termination of the third amended share exchange agreement, and who have not previously (i) had any direct or indirect business or investment relationship with diginex or its affiliates or (ii) engaged in any discussions with or contacted or been contacted by, directly or indirectly, or through any other person (including, its directors, officers and agents), diginex or the diginex’s affiliates, advisors or representatives regarding a potential business or investment relationship, until the closing date, or in the event the third amended shares exchange agreement is terminated, for a period of 12 months after the termination, and (b) without jfk’s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) diginex will not use any proceeds of the subsequent diginex private placement, up to $15,000,000, for any purpose other than its operating expenses and capital expenditures. the third amendment includes new covenants of all parties that, (a) jfk will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its service providers to enter into a lock-up agreement in connection with receipt of singapore newco ordinary shares that such service provider will receive for a period of no less than six months after the closing date, (b) jfk will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the balance of the trust account after giving effect to jfk’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account jfk’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the third amended share exchange agreement, to be an amount greater than or equal to $15,000,000, (c) prior to the closing date, diginex will use its commercially reasonable efforts to raise at least $15,000,000 through the subsequent diginex private placement, and (d) jfk and diginex will use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the nasdaq requirements. the third amendment includes new conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the share exchange, such as (i) the balance of the trust account will be an amount greater than or equal to $15,000,000 after giving effect to jfk’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account jfk’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the share exchange, and (ii) during the period commencing on april 24, 2020 and ending on the closing date, diginex will raise at least $15,000,000 through the subsequent diginex private placement. as a new condition to diginex’s obligation to consummate the share exchange, jfk will deliver to diginex evidence of the sponsor loan conversion. the existing condition to consummate the share exchange that jfk receives executed copies of lock-up agreements from all of the diginex shareholders has been revised, so that in diginex’s sole discretion up to 5,000,000 of the singapore newco ordinary shares issued in the subsequent diginex private placement may be issued without being subject to the restrictions in the lock-up agreement. the third amendment provides diginex the right, at its sole option, to terminate the third amended share exchange agreement if the nasdaq requirements are not met, or if after giving effect to the jfk ordinary share redemptions, the share exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby, jfk fails to comply with the net tangible assets requirements set forth in its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. on june 24, 2020, each of the parties to the third amendment entered into a fourth amendment to the share exchange agreement (the “fourth amendment,” and together with the share exchange agreement, the amendment, the second amendment and the third amendment, the “amended share exchange agreement”) to, among other things, (a) extend the outside closing date of the business combination to september 28, 2020 and (b) agree to hold the special meeting no later than september 15, 2020. the fourth amendment includes new covenants that all of the parties will, (i) take all steps required to extend the time available to consummate the business combination for an additional three months to september 30, 2020, including, sharing payment of the extension fees payable to the jfk trust account in the amount of $575,000, (ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill their respective covenants and closing conditions in order to hold the special meeting no later than september 15, 2020 and hold the closing of the business combination no later than september 28, 2020, and (iii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to have 6,411,100 of the singapore newco ordinary shares issuable, in the aggregate, to various parties pursuant to the share exchange agreement be freely tradeable from the day immediately following the closing date. the foregoing description of the fourth amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of

definitive agreement on july 9, 2019, 8i enterprises acquisition corp. (“jfk”) filed a current report on form 8-k to announce the entry into a share exchange agreement (the “share exchange agreement”) with diginex limited, a hong kong company (“diginex”), the stockholders of diginex (the “sellers”) and pelham limited, a hong kong company, as representative of the sellers (the “representative”). on october 8, 2019, each of the parties to the share exchange agreement entered into an amendment and joinder to the share exchange agreement (the “amendment”) with digital innovative limited, a singapore public company limited by shares (“singapore newco”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary digital innovative limited, a british virgin islands business company (“bvi newco”), for the purpose of joining both entities as parties to the share exchange agreement and amending the terms of the share exchange agreement. on january 28, 2020, each of the parties to the share exchange agreement and amendment entered into a second amendment to the share exchange agreement (the “second amendment”). the share exchange agreement originally provided that diginex may consummate a private placement of its ordinary shares of up to $25 million prior to the date the business combination is consummated (the “closing date”). the size of the private placement was increased to $30 million in the amendment. the purpose of the second amendment is to increase the size of the private placement from $30 million to $50 million. on may 6, 2020, each of the parties to the second amendment entered into a third amendment to the share exchange agreement (the “third amendment,” and together with the share exchange agreement, the amendment and the second amendment, the “amended share exchange agreement”) to, among other things, (a) extend the outside closing date of the transactions contemplated by the share exchange agreement (the “share exchange”) to june 23, 2020, (b) increase the number of ordinary shares of singapore newco (“singapore newco ordinary shares”) issuable to the sellers in the share exchange from 20,000,000 to 25,000,000, (c) increase the number of shares the sellers are entitled to receive if the closing price of the singapore newco ordinary shares satisfy certain thresholds (the “earnout shares”) from an aggregate of 5,000,000 to 12,000,000, adjust closing price targets and to increase the milestone dates by which the earnout shares could be issued from three years to four years after the anniversary of the closing date; (d) increase the number of options to purchase singapore newco ordinary shares received upon cancellation of the outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares under diginex’s existing incentive plan from 4,200,000 to 5,600,000, and (e) allow jfk to issue up to 1,000,000 singapore newco ordinary shares to third party advisors or consultants to (i) assist jfk with maintaining funds of at least $15,000,000 in the trust account after giving effect to all jfk ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account jfk’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the amended share exchange agreement, or (ii) provide market making services to diginex after the closing. the third amendment includes new covenants of the parties prior to the closing date, such as (a) jfk shall convert all outstanding promissory notes issued in favor of 8i enterprises pte. ltd. into jfk private units as of the closing date (the “sponsor loan conversion”), (b) jfk shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause chardan capital llc (“chardan”) to agree to convert, effective as of the closing date, deferred underwriting compensation in the amount of $1,725,000 owed to chardan and any additional fees to be paid by jfk to chardan upon the consummation of the closing into singapore newco ordinary shares at $10.00 per share, which shares will be subject to a lock-up agreement restricting any transfer thereof for a period of no less than six months after closing, (c) diginex will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its service providers to enter into a lock-up agreement in connection with receipt of singapore newco ordinary shares that such service provider will receive on the closing date for a period of no less than six months after the closing date, and (d) each of jfk and diginex will use best efforts to assist the other party to fulfill the new covenants relating to (i) jfk maintaining $15,000,000 in the trust account as of the closing date after giving effect to jfk’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account jfk’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the amended share exchange agreement, and (ii) diginex raising at least $15,000,000 through the issuance of new ordinary shares to be completed no later than the closing (the “subsequent diginex private placement”). the failure to comply with the covenants described in clause (d) of this paragraph will not constitute a material breach of the amended share exchange agreement for the purposes of fulfilling certain closing conditions of parties, or with respect to the indemnification or termination provisions set forth in the amended share exchange agreement. in the event the respective covenants that are the subject matter of (d) of this paragraph are not fulfilled, or, (i) if the market value of the unrestricted publicly held jfk ordinary shares (as calculated under the rules of the nasdaq capital market (“nasdaq”)) that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing date (after giving effect to the jfk ordinary share redemptions), and (ii) the combined stockholders equity of jfk and diginex (after giving effect to the jfk ordinary share redemptions, the share exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby), fail to satisfy nasdaq listing requirements ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “nasdaq requirements”), the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with respect thereto. however, if they are unable to reach an agreement, such failure will not be a material breach on the part of any party that elects to terminate the amended share exchange agreement because the transactions contemplated thereunder did not occur prior to june 23, 2020, the outside closing date. the third amendment includes new covenants of diginex that (a) without jfk’s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), diginex and its affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, or through any other person (including, its directors, officers and agents) engage with or contact, for the purpose of making an investment into diginex or any of its affiliates, any potential investor actually introduced to diginex or its affiliates by jfk or its affiliates during the period commencing on april 27, 2020 and ending on the earlier of the closing date and termination of the amended share exchange agreement, and who have not previously (i) had any direct or indirect business or investment relationship with diginex or its affiliates or (ii) engaged in any discussions with or contacted or been contacted by, directly or indirectly, or through any other person (including, its directors, officers and agents), diginex or the diginex’s affiliates, advisors or representatives regarding a potential business or investment relationship, until the closing date, or in the event the amended shares exchange agreement is terminated, for a period of 12 months after the termination, and (b) without jfk’s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) diginex will not use any proceeds of the subsequent diginex private placement, up to $15,000,000, for any purpose other than its operating expenses and capital expenditures. the third amendment includes new covenants of all parties that, (a) jfk will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its service providers to enter into a lock-up agreement in connection with receipt of singapore newco ordinary shares that such service provider will receive for a period of no less than six months after the closing date, (b) jfk will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the balance of the trust account after giving effect to jfk’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account jfk’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the amended share exchange agreement, to be an amount greater than or equal to $15,000,000, (c) prior to the closing date, diginex will use its commercially reasonable efforts to raise at least $15,000,000 through the subsequent diginex private placement, and (d) jfk and diginex will use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the nasdaq requirements. the third amendment includes new conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the share exchange, such as (i) the balance of the trust account will be an amount greater than or equal to $15,000,000 after giving effect to jfk’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account jfk’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the share exchange, and (ii) during the period commencing on april 24, 2020 and ending on the closing date, diginex will raise at least $15,000,000 through the subsequent diginex private placement. as a new condition to diginex’s obligation to consummate the share exchange, jfk will deliver to diginex evidence of the sponsor loan conversion. the existing condition to consummate the share exchange that jfk receives executed copies of lock-up agreements from all of the diginex shareholders has been revised, so that in diginex’s sole discretion up to 5,000,000 of the singapore newco ordinary shares issued in the subsequent diginex private placement may be issued without being subject to the restrictions in the lock-up agreement. the third amendment provides diginex the right, at its sole option, to terminate the amended share exchange agreement if the nasdaq requirements are not met, or if after giving effect to the jfk ordinary share redemptions, the share exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby, jfk fails to comply with the net tangible assets requirements set forth in its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. the foregoing description of the third amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the third amendment, a copy of which is

pte. ltd., a subsidiary of diginex, entered into an agreement for the purchase of certain software components (“software”). it is anticipated that the software will be integrated with modules developed by diginex and used as part of the digital assets exchange of diginex. as consideration for this acquisition, diginex will pay up to $10,000,000 depending on certain milestones being met, in a mixture of cash and diginex ordinary shares (if prior to the closing of the business combination) or singapore newco ordinary shares (if after the closing of the business combination). ● market maker agreement on march 15, 2020, diginex capital pte. ltd., a subsidiary of diginex, entered into a market making services agreement for the provision of market making services (the “services”) on the diginex digital assets exchange. in addition to trading related consideration, diginex will issue 5,850 diginex ordinary shares to be held in escrow and released to the market maker in six equal monthly installments subject to the achievement of certain performance metrics by the market maker in the provision of the services. ● option agreements pursuant to diginex’s permitted private placement to be consummated prior to the business combination, miles pelham granted options (the “options”) to purchase diginex ordinary shares held by the pelham limited to investors and one finder outside of the united states. such options have an exercise price of $153.90 per diginex share. as of march 16, 2020, a total of 17,725,000 options corresponding to 105,435 diginex ordinary shares were granted and may be exercised beginning on the earlier of (i) march 31, 2020, or (ii) 30 days following the closing of the business combination, and expire on (i) december 31, 2020, or (ii) 12 months following the closing of the business combination in the event the business combination is consummated. following the business combination, upon exercise, option holders will receive ordinary shares of singapore newco rather than diginex ordinary shares. an aggregate of 1,687,248 shares of singapore newco will be subject to these options at an exercise price of $153.90 for every sixteen shares. diginex had projected revenues of $2.1 million for the year ended march 2020, which is now forecast to be $0.6 million. this shortfall is primarily due to a delay in a capital markets transaction and the probable cancellation of another mandate within diginex’s capital markets business. since october 1, 2019 to date, diginex has issued 156,130 shares and received consideration of $25.2 million, $15.9 million in cash and $9.3 million for the acquisition of technology and consultancy services. diginex expects to issue an additional 2,437 of its shares in exchange for consultancy services valued at $0.4 million. signatures pursuant to the requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the

those indicated or anticipated. such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (i) risks related to the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the business combination, including the risk that the business combination may not close due to one or more closing conditions to the business combination not being satisfied or waived on a timely basis or otherwise; (ii) the

the share exchange agreement on july 9, 2019, 8i enterprises acquisition corp. (“jfk”) filed a current report on form 8-k to announce the entry into a share exchange agreement (the “share exchange agreement”) with diginex limited, a hong kong company (“diginex”), the stockholders of diginex (the “sellers”) and pelham limited, a hong kong company, as representative of the sellers (the “representative”). amendment and joinder to the share exchange agreement on october 8, 2019, each of the parties to the share exchange agreement entered into an amendment and joinder to the share exchange agreement (the “amendment”) with digital innovative limited, a singapore public company limited by shares (“singapore newco”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary digital innovative limited, a british virgin islands business company (“bvi newco”), for the purpose of joining both entities as parties to the share exchange agreement and amending the terms of the share exchange agreement. the amendment reflects the restructuring of the proposed transactions described herein (the “business combination”) as initially contemplated in the share exchange agreement to effect a merger whereby bvi newco will merge with and into jfk, the corporate existence of bvi newco will cease and jfk, as the surviving company, will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of singapore newco. singapore newco would qualify as a foreign private issuer as of the closing of the business combination. this merger is referred to herein as the “reincorporation merger,” the details of which are described below under “summary of the merger agreement.” the amendment provides, among other things, that (i) consummation of the reincorporation merger is a condition to the completion by diginex and jfk of their respective obligations under the share exchange agreement to sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to jfk all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of diginex owned by the sellers, and in exchange for such transfer, the issuance by jfk to the sellers of an aggregate of 20,000,000 ordinary shares, no par value, of jfk (the “share exchange”), (ii) singapore newco ordinary shares will be issued to the sellers in the share exchange in lieu of jfk ordinary shares, (iii) references to the proxy statement in the share exchange agreement are replaced with references to the proxy statement/prospectus to be included in the registration statement on form f-4 to be jointly filed by jfk and singapore newco, and (iv) references to the purchaser and its obligations (x) post-closing, (y) with respect to nasdaq matters, and (z) for directors’ and officers’ indemnification and liability insurance in the share exchange agreement, are replaced with singapore newco. the amendment also modified the manner in which each option to purchase ordinary shares of diginex issued and outstanding immediately prior to the business combination (the “diginex options”) would be treated in connection with the share exchange. at the consummation of the business combination, the diginex options will be automatically cancelled and exchanged for 4,200,000 options to receive singapore newco ordinary shares (“singapore newco options”). the singapore newco options may not be transferred, assigned or sold. each singapore newco option will, without any requirement for payment, automatically convert into a singapore newco ordinary share on a one-to-one basis as follows: (a) one-third on the date that is 15 months after the closing of the business combination, (b) one-third on the date that is 18 months after the closing of the business combination and (c) one-third on the date that is 21 months after the closing of the business combination, in each case provided that the holder of the options remains employed by, or, if such holder is an independent contractor, is still under a contractual arrangement with, singapore newco or its affiliates as of the date that is 15 months after the closing of the business combination. the singapore newco options to be issued in connection with the business combination will be separate from and in addition to any options or other awards issued or issuable by singapore newco under the digital innovative limited 2019 omnibus incentive plan. the foregoing description of the amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the amendment, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. summary of the merger agreement the agreement to effect the reincorporation merger was entered into by and among singapore newco, bvi newco and jfk on october 8, 2019 (the “merger agreement”). upon the approval of the merger agreement and a plan of merger by and among jfk and bvi newco (the “plan of merger”), by the jfk shareholders, bvi newco and jfk will execute articles of merger and the plan of merger, which are statutory filings required to be filed with the registrar of corporate affairs in the british virgin islands prior to the effective date of the reincorporation merger (the “effective date”). on the effective date, bvi newco will merge with and into jfk, the corporate existence of bvi newco will cease and jfk, as the surviving company, will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of singapore newco. as a result of the reincorporation merger, the jfk shareholders will no longer be shareholders of jfk and will instead become shareholders of singapore newco. pursuant to the merger agreement, on the effective date: (a) each jfk ordinary share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective date (other than any redeemed shares and the shares share owned by jfk shareholders who exercises their right to dissent in accordance with section 179 of the bvi business companies act, 2004, as amended (each a “dissenting shareholder”), as hereinafter defined (each a “dissenting share”)), will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and for each such jfk ordinary share, singapore newco will issue to each jfk shareholder (other than the dissenting shareholders and jfk shareholders who exercise their redemption rights) one (1) singapore newco ordinary share; (b) each share in bvi newco in issue immediately prior to the effective date will be automatically converted into one validly issued and fully paid ordinary share with no par value in jfk as the surviving company; (c) each dissenting share held by a dissenting shareholder (who has not effectively withdrawn its right to such dissent) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive payment resulting from the procedure in section 179 of the bvi bc act and such dissenting shareholders will not be entitled to receive any of the singapore newco ordinary shares; (d) each jfk warrant will be cancelled and cease to exist and for each such jfk warrant, singapore newco will issue to each holder thereof an identical singapore newco warrant to purchase singapore newco ordinary shares; and (e) each jfk right will be cancelled and cease to exist and for each such jfk right, singapore newco will issue to each holder thereof one-tenth (1/10) of one singapore newco ordinary share. the merger agreement may be terminated (i) at any time prior to the effective date by written consent of the parties, and (ii) if the reincorporation merger proposal and/or the share exchange proposal is not approved by the jfk shareholders at the meeting to approve the business combination. the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement and the form of articles of merger and plan of merger do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the form of articles of merger and plan of merger, copies of which are filed as exhibit 2.2 and exhibit 2.3
