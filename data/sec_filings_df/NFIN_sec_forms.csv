expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside netfin’s, the netfin representative’s, the seller’s and the target’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against netfin, the netfin representative, the seller’s and the target following the announcement of the business combination agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (2) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of netfin’s shareholders or other conditions to closing in the business combination agreement; (3) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement or could otherwise cause the transactions contemplated therein to fail to close; (4) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the holdco ordinary shares on nasdaq following the business combination; (5) the risk that the business combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the business combination; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (7) costs related to the business combination; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the possibility that netfin, the netfin representative, the seller’s, the target or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (10) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” in the registration statement, and in netfin’s other filings with the sec. netfin cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. netfin cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. netfin does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k shall not constitute a solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the business combination. this current report on form 8-k shall also not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall
