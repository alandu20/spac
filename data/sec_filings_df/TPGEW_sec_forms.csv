agreement), by and between the company and the warrant agent. the warrant amendment amends the warrant agreement to provide the company with the right to require the holders of the companys publicly traded warrants (the public warrants) and private warrants (the private warrants and, together with the public warrants, the warrants) to exchange their warrants for shares of the companys class a common stock, par value $0.0001 (class a common stock), at an exchange ratio of 0.261 shares of class a common stock for each warrant. the company has the right to require the exchange of not less than all of the warrants at any time while such warrants are exercisable and prior to their expiration, at the office of the warrant agent, upon notice to the registered holders of the outstanding warrants not less than fifteen days prior to the date of exchange fixed by the company. the foregoing description of the warrant amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the warrant amendment, which is filed as exhibit 4.1 to this current report on form 8-k and is incorporated by reference herein. item 5.07 submission of matters to a vote of security holders. as

consents (the consent solicitation) from holders of each of the public warrants and the private warrants to approve the warrant amendment. the offer and consent solicitation expired at 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on july 5, 2019. a total of 31,509,226 warrants, or approximately 99.3% of the 21,666,650 outstanding public warrants and 100% of the 10,000,000 outstanding private warrants, were properly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer, and were therefore deemed to have consented to the warrant amendment. because consents were received from holders of more than a majority of each of the companys private warrants and public warrants, the warrant amendment was approved. item 8.01 other events. on july 10, 2019, the company issued a press release announcing the closing of the offer and the consent solicitation. in connection with the closing, the company issued 9,137,638 shares of class a common stock in exchange for the warrants tendered in the offer, resulting in a total of 168,029,468 shares of class a common stock outstanding as of july 10, 2019. the company also announced that it intends to exchange all remaining untendered warrants for shares of class a common

expenses), and for working capital and other general purposes from time to time, on the closing date, magnolia operating entered into a senior secured reserve-based revolving credit facility (the rbl facility) among magnolia operating, as borrower, magnolia oil & gas intermediate llc, a delaware limited liability company and wholly 2 owned subsidiary of magnolia llc (magnolia intermediate), as holdings, the banks, financial institutions and other lending institutions from time to time party thereto, as lenders, the other parties from time to time party thereto and citibank, n.a., as administrative agent, collateral agent, issuing bank and swingline lender, providing for maximum commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000 million with a letter of credit facility with a $100 million sublimit. the rbl facility has an initial borrowing base of $550 million. the rbl facility is guaranteed by magnolia intermediate, magnolia llc, magnolia oil & gas corporation and magnolia oil & gas finance corp., a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of magnolia operating (finance corp). the rbl facility is secured by substantially all of the natural gas and oil properties and personal property assets of magnolia operating, magnolia intermediate and finance corp. certain future-formed or acquired wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of magnolia operating will also be required to guarantee the rbl facility and grant a security interest in substantially all of their natural gas and oil properties and personal property assets to secure the obligations under the rbl facility. the rbl facility limits the amounts magnolia operating can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the administrative agent and required lenders thereunder will in good faith determine, in accordance with their respective usual and customary oil and gas lending criteria, based upon the loan value of the proved oil and gas reserves located within the geographic boundaries of the united states included in the most recent reserve report provided to the administrative agent and the lenders. the rbl facility requires semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations based on reserve reports. additionally, the borrowing base will be subject to unscheduled redeterminations, once per year at the request of the required lenders, up to two times per year at the request of magnolia operating and an unlimited number of times at magnolia operatings request in connection with an acquisition of natural gas and oil properties with a present value in excess of 5% of the then-effective borrowing base. furthermore, the borrowing base may be reduced from time to time due to certain issuances of new unsecured senior, senior subordinated, junior lien or subordinated indebtedness, certain sales of borrowing base properties, early monetizations or terminations of certain hedge or swap positions or at magnolia operatings request. if the aggregate amount outstanding under the rbl facility exceeds the lesser of the rbl facility commitments and the borrowing base at any time, magnolia operating would be required to repay any indebtedness or to provide mortgages on additional borrowing base properties to eliminate such excess. borrowings under the rbl facility bear interest, at magnolia operatings option, at a rate per annum equal to either (a) the adjusted libor rate (libor) (which cannot be less than zero) for interest periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months (or if available to all lenders, 12 months or any period shorter than 1 month) plus the applicable libor margin or (b) the alternative base rate (abr) plus the applicable abr margin. abr is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds effective rate plus 1⁄2 of 1.0%, (ii) the prime rate announced from time to time by citibank, n.a. and (iii) libor for a 1-month interest period on such day plus 1.0%. interest is payable quarterly in arrears for abr loans, at the end of the applicable interest period for libor loans (but not less frequently than quarterly) and upon the prepayment or maturity of the underlying loans. additionally, magnolia operating is required to pay a commitment fee quarterly in arrears in respect of unused commitments under the rbl facility. the applicable libor and abr margins and the commitment fee rate are calculated based upon the utilization levels of the rbl facility as a percentage of the borrowing base then in effect, as set forth below: borrowing base utilization percentage x < 25% 25% £ x< 50% 50% £ x< 75% 75% £x< 90% x ³ 90% libor margin 1.75 % 2.00 % 2.25 % 2.50 % 2.75 % abr margin 0.75 % 1.00 % 1.25 % 1.50 % 1.75 % commitment fee rate 0.375 % 0.375 % 0.375 % 0.50 % 0.50 % the rbl facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, and requires magnolia operating and certain of its affiliates obligated under the rbl facility to make customary representations and warranties in connection with credit extensions thereunder. the negative covenants, among other things and subject to significant exceptions, limit the ability of magnolia operating and certain of its subsidiaries to:  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; 3  make loans to others;  make investments;  merge or consolidate with another entity;  make dividends and certain other payments;  hedge future production or interest rates;  create liens that secure indebtedness;  transfer or sell assets;  enter into transactions with affiliates; and  engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders. in addition, the rbl facility requires magnolia operating to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitdax no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending on or after december 31, 2018. if such ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00 in any such fiscal quarter, magnolia operating will also be required to maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for such fiscal quarter. the ratios are to be determined on the basis of the four most recently ended fiscal quarters of magnolia operating for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to the rbl facility. if an event of default (as such term is defined in the rbl facility) occurs, the lenders would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the rbl facility, termination of the lenders commitments thereunder, foreclosure on collateral, and all other remedial actions available to a secured creditor. the lenders under the rbl facility are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities. certain of the lenders under the rbl facility and their affiliates have in the past performed services for the company or its affiliates from time to time and may engage in transactions with and perform services for the company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their business. the foregoing description of the rbl facility is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the rbl facility, a copy of which

(2) the estimated net proved reserves as of december 31, 2017 were determined using average first-day-of-the month prices for the prior twelve (12) months in accordance with sec rules. for oil and ngl volumes, the average wti posted price of $51.34 per barrel as of december 31, 2017 was adjusted for quality, transportation fees and a regional price differential. for natural gas volumes, the average henry hub spot price of $2.98 per mmbtu as of december 31, 2017 was adjusted for energy content, transportation fees and a regional price differential. all prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. the average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the target assets were $49.33 per barrel of oil, $21.92 per barrel of ngl and $2.74 per mcf of natural gas as of december 31, 2017. 2 as of december 31, 2017(five (5) year development plan)sec pricing proved undeveloped reserves (mboe) 98,473 proved developed reserves (mboe)(1) 66,126 proved reserves (mboe)(2) 164,599 pv-10 (in thousands) $ 1,967,179 (1) includes 53,441 mboe of proved developed producing reserves and 12,685 mboe of proved developed nonproducing reserves.

(2) includes 54,670 mboe of proved developed producing reserves and 12,703 mboe of proved developed nonproducing reserves. ****** for illustrative purposes only, if the estimated net proved reserves of the target assets as of december 31, 2017 were instead prepared to reflect the sellers five (5) year development plan as of december 31, 2017, the estimated proved reserves of the target assets would have been as set forth in the following table, which includes estimates based on sec pricing. as of december 31, 2017 (sellers five (5) year development plan) oil(mbbls) natural gas(mmcf) ngl(mbbls) total(mboe) estimated proved reserves total proved developed 33,007 117,541 13,529 66,126 total proved undeveloped 65,140 106,384 15,602 98,473 total proved reserves 98,147 223,925 29,131 164,599 ****** we expect our debt outstanding following the completion of the transactions, including the consummation of this offering, to be $400 million, which is under 12% of our total expected capitalization, and we expect to have at least $650 million in liquidity, including available borrowings under our $1.0 billion rbl facility (initial borrowing base of $550 million and $100 million of cash). item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits (d) exhibits. the following exhibit is filed with this form 8-k: exhibit no. description of exhibits 99.1 press release, dated july 10, 2018. legend information forward-looking statements the information in this current report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act, and section 21e of the exchange act. all statements, other than statements of present or historical fact included in this current report, regarding the proposed business combination, the companys ability to consummate the business combination, the benefits of the transaction and the companys future financial performance following the business combination, as well as the companys strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues, and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward looking statements. when used in this current report, including any oral statements made in connection therewith, the words could, should, will, may, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, expect, project, the negative of such terms and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. these forward-looking statements are based on managements current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. except as otherwise required by applicable law, the company disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the 4 statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this current report. the company cautions you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company, incident to the development, production, gathering and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. in addition, the company cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained in this current report are subject to the following factors: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could delay the business combination or give rise to the termination of the business combination agreements;
