furthermore, during the period described above, there have been no disagreements with ernst & young llp on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to ernst & young llp’s satisfaction, would have caused ernst & young llp to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on trinity’s financial statements for such period. upon consummation of the business combination, ernst & young llp ceased to be the independent registered public accounting firm for the company and the company intends to retain moss adams llp as its independent registered public accounting firm. the company has provided ernst & young llp with a copy of the foregoing disclosure and has requested that ernst & young llp furnish the company with a letter addressed to the sec stating whether or not it agrees with the statements made herein, each as required by applicable sec rules. a copy of ernst & young llp’s letter, dated november 20, 2019, is attached as exhibit 16.2 to this report. 11 cohnreznick llp (“cohnreznick”) previously audited the financial

combination, as discussed below, on or about april 19, 2019 each of pbrelf, brelf ii, and brelf iii dismissed cohnreznick as its principal accountant and each of pbrelf, brelf ii, brelf iii, brelf iv, mgco i, mgco ii, mgco iii, and mgco iv engaged moss adams llp as its independent registered public accounting firm. cohnreznick’s reports on the financial statements of each of pbrelf and brelf ii as of and for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2018 and of brelf iii as of and for the year ended december 31, 2018 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. furthermore, during the period described above, there have been no disagreements with cohnreznick on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to satisfaction of such firm, would have caused such firm to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on audited financial statements for such period. cohnreznick has been provided a copy of this form 8-k and requested to provide a letter addressed to the sec stating whether or not cohnreznick agrees with the statements related to it made in this report. a copy of cohnreznick’s letter, dated november 19, 2019, is attached as

below, and in the financial statements related to the following entities included in the prospectus and audited by moss adams llp, there were no “reportable events” as that term is described in item 304(a)(1)(v) of regulation s-k. during the audits of the financial statements of pbrelf, brelf ii, brelf iii, brelf iv, mgco i, mgco ii, mgco iii, and mgco iv included in the prospectus, moss adams llp noted deficiencies within the financial closing and reporting process due to lack of segregation of duties, including access controls of information technology over sensitive and critical financial information, lack of review procedures over financial information and inadequate documentation of policies and procedures over the identification of technical accounting matters, and related documentation addressing accounting matters. with respect to the audits of pbrelf, brelf ii, brelf iii, and brelf iv, the lack of controls contributed to certain proposed audit adjustments related to deferred fees and missing or incomplete disclosures related to equity structure/share counts, credit quality disclosures and cash flow statements in the footnotes to the financial statements. as such, moss adams llp identified material weaknesses in the internal control over financial close reporting process. with respect to mgco i, mgco ii, mgco iii, and mgco iv, the lack of controls contributed to the inability to record certain material adjustments to the financial statements related to cash and related party reclassifications, compensation expense and completeness and accuracy and/or missing or incomplete disclosures related to certain statements related to equity structure/share count. as such, moss adams llp has identified material weaknesses in the internal control over financial close reporting process. the company intends to take steps to remediate these material weaknesses, including enlisting the help of external advisors to provide assistance in the areas of internal controls and generally accepted accounting principles (“gaap”) in the short term, and are evaluating the longer-term resource needs of its accounting staff, including gaap expertise. these remediation measures may be time consuming and costly, and might place significant demands on its financial, accounting and operational resources. in addition, there is no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring any necessary finance and accounting personnel in a timely manner, or at all. financial statements and exhibits. reference is also made to the disclosure set forth under
