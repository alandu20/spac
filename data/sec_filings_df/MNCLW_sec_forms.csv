results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, monocle’s and aersale’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside monocle’s and aersale’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against monocle and aersale following the announcement of the merger agreement and the business combination; (3) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to failure to obtain approvals from the stockholders of monocle and aersale or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the shares of common stock of the post-acquisition company on the nasdaq stock market following the business combination; (5) the risk that the business combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the business combination; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (7) costs related to the business combination; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the possibility that aersale or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (10) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and in monocle’s other filings with the sec. monocle cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. monocle further cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. monocle does not undertake to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based unless required to do so under applicable law. no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k is not a proxy statement or solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the proposed business combination and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale
