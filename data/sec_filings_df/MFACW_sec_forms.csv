by reference in any filing under the securities act or the exchange act. 6 forward looking statements certain statements made herein are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as “may”, “should”, “would”, “plan”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “seem”, “seek”, “continue”, “future”, “will”, “expect”, “outlook” or other similar words, phrases or expressions. these forward-looking statements include statements regarding megalith’s industry, future events, the proposed transaction between the parties, the estimated or anticipated future results and benefits of the combined company following the merger, including the likelihood and ability of the parties to successfully consummate the proposed merger, future opportunities for the combined company, and other statements that are not historical facts. these statements are based on the current expectations of megalith’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. these statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties regarding megalith’s businesses and the transaction, and actual results may differ materially. these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement and the proposed merger contemplated thereby; (2) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of megalith or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (3) the inability to meet the minimum cash requirements of the merger agreement due to the inability to consummate the pipe investment or the amount of cash available following any redemptions by megalith stockholders; (4) the ability to meet nyse’s listing standards following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (5) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of bankmobile as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transaction described herein; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain its management and key employees; (7) costs related to the proposed merger; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the possibility that bankmobile may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (10) megalith’s ability to identify and integrate acquisition; and (11) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the final prospectus of megalith, including those under “risk factors” therein, and other documents filed or to be filed with the securities and exchange commission (“sec”) by megalith. there may be additional risks that megalith presently does not know or that megalith currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements provide megalith’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. megalith anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause megalith’s assessments to change. however, while megalith may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, megalith specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing megalith’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.
