(the “company”) approved a corporate bonus program that will be utilized to calculate cash and equity bonuses that may become payable to the company’s employees with respect to the second half of fiscal year 2020 (the “second half of 2020 employee mbo plan”). the compensation committee of the board (the “compensation committee”) will administer this plan, which applies to all employees of the company and its subsidiaries, including its two named executive officers — its chief executive officer, dario calogero, and its chief financial officer, giacomo dall’aglio. the second half of 2020 employee mbo plan is designed to align employees with the company’s business goals and strategies, and to further the objectives of the company’s compensation program. payouts under the second half of 2020 employee mbo plan will be determined by the compensation committee following the conclusion of the 2020 fiscal year end, and bonuses will be based on the company achieving objectively determinable company financial performance targets (the “company performance objectives”), and by employees based on their individual achievement of pre-determined “management by objectives” (mbos). the percentage of the target bonus for the named executive officers that is subject to the company performance objectives and the mbos will each be fifty percent. the company performance objectives will be measured by the achievement of specific financial goals related to both a revenue and an adjusted ebitda achievement requirement for the second half of the 2020 fiscal year. adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (“gaap”). adjusted ebitda is defined as of any date of calculation, as the consolidated pro forma earnings of the company and its subsidiaries, before finance income and finance cost (including bank charges), tax, depreciation and amortization, plus (i) transaction expenses, (ii) without duplication of clause (i), severance or change of control payments, (iii) any expenses related to company restructuring, (iv) the adjusted ebitda for pre-acquisition period of subsidiaries, (v) any compensation expenses relating to stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock or similar equity interests as may be issued by the company or any of its subsidiaries to its or their employees and (vi) any provision for the write down of assets. this non-gaap financial measure is not a measure prepared in accordance with gaap and might not be consistent with similar measures used by other companies. it shall not be considered as an alternative to any other measures of performance prepared under gaap. at target revenue performance, sixty percent of the company performance objectives component of the bonus is earned, and at target adjusted ebitda performance, the other forty percent of the company performance objectives component of the bonus is earned. threshold performance of either the revenue performance or adjusted ebitda performance component of the company performance objectives is at eighty percent of target and will result in a proportional portion of the respective component of the company performance objectives being earned. any bonuses payable pursuant to the second half of 2020 employment mbo plan will be paid in a combination of cash and/or in the form of restricted stock units (“rsus”). for the named executive officers, up to fifty percent of the bonus will be paid in cash and 50% of the bonus will be paid in rsus. the total amount of the bonus for which each of the named executive officers is eligible is fifty percent of their base salaries for the second half of fiscal year 2020. pursuant to the requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. dated: july 17, 2020 by: /s/ dario calogero name: dario calogero title: chief executive officer and president ",8-K,2020-07-17 16:10:57

december 7, 2017, gigcapital (now kaleyra) entered into a registration rights agreement with certain of its stockholders (the registration rights holders), pursuant to which such registration rights

the business combination. under the registration rights agreement, the registration rights holders hold registration rights that obligate kaleyra to register for resale under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the securities act), all or any portion of the registrable securities (as defined in the registration rights agreement) held by the registration rights holders. each or any of

exceptions, if any time after the closing, kaleyra proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to its securities, under the registration rights agreement, kaleyra

agreed to indemnify the registration rights holders and certain persons or entities related to the registration rights holders against any losses or damages resulting from any untrue statement or omission of a material fact in any registration statement or prospectus pursuant to which they sell registrable securities, unless such liability arose from their misstatement or omission, and such stockholders, including registrable securities in any registration statement or prospectus will agree to indemnify kaleyra and certain persons or entities related to kaleyra against all losses caused by their misstatements or omissions in those documents. this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the registration rights agreement, which is included as exhibit 10.1 to this current report on form 8-k and is incorporated herein by reference. item 2.01. completion of acquisition of disposition of assets. on november 22, 2019, gigcapital held a special meeting at which the gigcapital stockholders considered and adopted, among other matters, the stock purchase agreement. on november 25, 2019, the parties to the stock purchase agreement consummated the business combination (such consummation, the closing). prior to the special meeting, holders of 3,668,303 shares of gigcapitals common stock sold in its initial public offering (public shares) exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at a price of $10.5019 per share, for an aggregate of approximately $38.5 million. immediately after giving effect to the business combination (including as a result of the redemptions described above and the automatic conversion of gigcapital rights into kaleyra common stock), there were 19,977,101 shares of kaleyras issued and outstanding common stock. upon the closing, gigcapitals rights and units ceased trading, and kaleyras common stock began trading on the nyse american llc (nyse american) under the symbol klr. furthermore, kaleyras warrants subsequently on december 2, 2019 began trading on the nyse american as klr ws. as of the date of closing, our directors and executive officers and affiliated entities beneficially owned approximately 63.36% of kaleyras outstanding shares of common stock, and the former securityholders of gigcapital beneficially owned approximately 46.50% of kaleyras outstanding shares. as noted above, the per share redemption price of $10.5019 for holders of public shares electing redemption was paid out of gigcapitals trust account, which after taking into account the redemptions, had a balance immediately prior to the closing of approximately $40.8 million. in addition, approximately $14,000 remained in gigcapitals operating account immediately prior to the closing. form 10 information item 2.01(f) of form 8-k states that if the predecessor registrant was a shell company, as gigcapital was immediately before the business combination, then the registrant must disclose the information that would be required if the registrant were filing a general form for registration of securities on form 10. accordingly, kaleyra is providing the information below that would be included in a form 10 if kaleyra were to file a form 10. please note that the information provided below relates to the combined company after the consummation of the business combination, unless

completion of the business combination, the financial statements of kaleyra s.p.a. are now the financial statements of kaleyra. thus, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of kaleyra included elsewhere in this filing. as of september 30, 2019, kaleyra s.p.a. was a private company and this managements discussion and analysis does not give effect to the closing of the business combination. this discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting kaleyras current expectations,

communications platform that seamlessly integrates software services and applications for business-to-consumer communications between kaleyras customers and their end-user customers and partners on a global basis. these communications are increasingly managed through mobile network operators as the gateway to reach end-user consumers mobile devices. kaleyras platform enables these communications by integrating mobile alert notifications and interactive capabilities to reach and engage end user customers. it does so, coupled with a software as a service (saas) business model, creating what is generally referred to as a cloud communications platform as a service, or simply cpaas. kaleyras solutions include identity authentication, mobile and voice notifications on transactions, banking services authorizations, most notably via different integrated mobile channels through its platform. kaleyras vision is to be the cpaas provider, which best aligns with its customers communication requirements, or most trusted provider, in the world. this requires a combination of security, compliance and integration capabilities that protects the integrity and privacy of kaleyras customers and business partners transactions and includes other key features such as ease of provisioning, reliable network connectivity, high availability for scaling, redundancy, embedded regulatory compliance, configurable monitoring and reporting. kaleyra believes the percentage of cpaas customers that will require security, compliance and integration will represent an increasingly larger portion of the market, particularly with the expected exponential growth of transactional-by-nature cloud communications applications, better enabling kaleyra to set itself apart from its competition. 4 kaleyra s.p.a. is a result of the expansion of the former ubiquity, which was founded in milan, italy in 1999. after securing a leading market position in mobile messaging in the italian financial services industry, kaleyra s.p.a. sought to expand its products and geographic offerings. ubiquity acquired solutions infini in bangalore, india beginning in 2017 and buc mobile in vienna, virginia in 2018. it was rebranded kaleyra and renamed kaleyra s.p.a. in february 2018. kaleyra s.p.a. combined with gigcapital on november 25, 2019 to form kaleyra. during the year ending december 31, 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. processed nearly 23 billion billable messages and 1 billion voice calls. kaleyra organizes its efforts in three principal offices in washington dc (northern virginia), milan, italy and bangalore india with an employee base of 240 employees. as of september 30, 2019, kaleyra s.p.a. employed 258 employees in its principal locations. kaleyra has more than 3,000 customers and business partners worldwide across industry verticals such as financial services, ecommerce and transportation, with no single customer representing more than 15% of revenues. kaleyras customers are located in regions throughout the world including in europe, asia pacific and north america. kaleyras top volume by country includes the following countries in order of volume: italy, india, united kingdom, united states, netherlands, south africa and china. in 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. had one customer, telecom italia s.p.a. which accounted for more than 10% of kaleyra s.p.a.s revenues. in 2017, there were four customers  telecom italia s.p.a., fastweb s.p.a., vodafone italian s.p.a. and wind technologies s.p.a. that accounted for more than 10% on an individual basis of kaleyra s.p.a.s revenues. kaleyra s.p.a. has multiple, large european commercial banks as business partners, with one of these partners, intesa sanpaolo s.p.a., accounting for more than 10% of kaleyras volumes in 2018 and 2017. for the nine months ended september 30, 2019, 80% of revenue came from customers of kaleyra s.p.a. which have been on the platform for at least two years, and 90% from customers which have been on the platform for at least one year. although kaleyra continues to expand by introducing new customers to the platform, the breadth and stability of its existing customers provide it with a solid base of revenue upon which it can continue to innovate and make investment to strengthen its product portfolio, expand its global presence, and in particular into the north america and asia-pacific markets with the acquired solutions infinity and buc mobile businesses, recruit world-class talent and target accretive acquisitions to capitalize on its growing market penetration opportunities and value creation. kaleyras underlying technology used in the platform is the same across all of its communication services which can generally be described as omni-channel mobile first interactive notifications via a public or private cloud implementation. these services include programmable voice/interactive voice response (ivr) configurations, inbound/outbound short message service capabilities, hosted telephone numbers, and other types of ip communications services such as e-mail and whatsapp®. kaleyras customers are enterprises which use digital, mobile communications in the conduct of their business. kaleyras platform enables these communications by integrating mobile alert notifications and interactive capabilities to reach and engage end user customers. kaleyra enables its customers and business partners to connect enterprise software and applications to mobile network operators by providing a single simple interface by which kaleyra can undertake as necessary to make upgrades in its service offerings to account for new end-user consumer behavior changes and progress (such as adding whatsapp® integration). kaleyra services a broad base of customers throughout the world operating in diverse businesses and regions. kaleyras business is generated by providing data to the telecommunications provider and transmitting message data from its customers or business partners. kaleyra has a concentration of business within the financial services industry that serves their major european banking end-user customers. with each relationship kaleyra is the link between the financial institutions and their unique, end-user customers. in linking these two parties, kaleyras platform leverages the end-user telecommunications provider to transmit critical message data to these end-user customers. for the nine months ended september 30, 2019 and the financial years 2018 and 2017, all of kaleyra s.p.a.s revenue was derived from its messaging products in the cpaas market. in 2017 and 2018, the acquisitions of solutions infini and buc mobile, respectively, significantly affected comparability of kaleyra s.p.a.s results of operations and metrics in both periods. please see the subsection below titled recent acquisitions for further information regarding these acquisitions. 5 kaleyra s.p.a.s revenue is primarily driven by the number of messages delivered to its customers and business partners. kaleyra s.p.a.s fees vary depending on the contract. in 2018, excluding the effects of the consolidation of solutions infini and buc mobile, the number of messages delivered to customers increased by 28.3%, compared to the prior year. such increase was driven by new services delivered to existing customers and business partners as well as to a volume delivered to a new customer. kaleyras business partners in italy mainly consist of banks and other credit card issuers that connect to their customers (end-user customers) sending high-secured and reliable messages through kaleyras platform. volume increase has been driven by the increased number of digital payments transactions made by the end-users customers (such as credit card transactions and other digital payments) and by the increasing penetration rate of digital payments in the underlying payments markets. kaleyra is exposed to fluctuations of the currencies in which its transactions are denominated. specifically, a material portion of kaleyras revenues and purchases are denominated in euro and indian rupees. factors affecting comparability of results recent acquisitions acquisition of solutions infini in june 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. completed the business combination of solutions infini, a technology developer and platform provider for bulk messaging services, headquartered in bangalore, india (the solutions infini acquisition). before control was achieved in june 2018, the investment in solutions infini was accounted for as a joint venture. the acquisition of solutions infini added significant value to kaleyra from a technology, talent and product perspective. the base purchase price payable as consideration for all of the shares of solutions infini was equal to inr 1,025,050 thousand, subject to variations if solutions infini reached targeted levels of ebitda and net financial position for the years ending march 31, 2018 and a target level of ebitda for the fiscal year ending march 31, 2019. according to the purchase agreement, kaleyra was entitled to acquire all the shares of solutions infini in different stages and with multiples payments. in particular, based on the terms of the purchase agreement, in 2017 kaleyra s.p.a. paid $8,083 thousand, in july 2018 paid $6,602 thousand and in july 2019 paid $5,084 thousand (including $770 thousand originally due in july 2020). solutions infini contributed $21,176 thousand to kaleyra s.p.a.s consolidated total revenues during the six months that it was consolidated in 2018 and $43,778 thousand during the nine months ended september 30, 2019 and represented 27.2% and 46.64% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 and the nine months ended september 30, 2019, respectively. in 2018, costs incurred related to this acquisition of $216 thousand were reported as an element of expense in general and administrative expenses. acquisition of buc mobile on july 31, 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of buc mobile, a company headquartered in vienna, virginia in the united states and incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware, operating in the application to person (a2p) transactional and promotional messaging business (the buc mobile acquisition). the acquisition of buc mobile provided an opportunity for kaleyra s.p.a. to acquire a technology platform designed for high-volume transactions and an experienced u.s. based management team. the purchase price for the buc mobile acquisition is an aggregate sum of $6,286,250 payable as consideration for all of the shares of buc mobile to be paid in cash in three different installments, specifically: $2,286,250 was paid in cash on july 31, 2018, $2,000,000 was paid on july 31, 2019, and $2,000,000, originally due in july 2020, was paid in advance on july 31, 2019. in addition, kaleyra s.p.a. agreed to issue 3,543 new shares of common stock to the former shareholders of buc mobile which were provided to them as additional consideration for the transaction at the date of the business combination. additionally, as established by the buc mobile purchase agreement, a price adjustment of $159 thousand determined on the basis of buc mobiles net working capital measured at closing was paid in december 2018. 6 buc mobile contributed $2,645 thousand to the consolidated total revenues during the five months that it was consolidated in 2018 and $6,580 thousand during the nine months ended september 30, 2019 and represented 3.4% and 7.0% of the consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 and the nine months ended september 30, 2019, respectively. in 2018, costs related to this acquisition of $870 thousand were reported as an element of expense in general and administrative expenses. stock-based compensation in january 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. adopted a stock-based compensation plan with an original vesting period of three years. in november 2018, the kaleyra s.p.a. board of directors resolved to amend the original terms of this plan, substantially accelerating the vesting of the awarded stock options and granting to the plans beneficiaries the right to exercise all of the stock options awarded and not previously exercised, either vested or unvested, regardless of the fulfilment of any performance conditions, provided, in any case, that the beneficiary was employed by kaleyra s.p.a. or any of its subsidiaries as of the exercise date. as of december 31, 2018, all of the stock options awarded were exercised. the entire stock-based compensation expense associated with this plan amounting to $7,359 thousand was recognized in the year ended december 31, 2018. the incremental portion of such compensation cost expense resulting from the plans modification and subsequent termination was equal to $5,735 thousand. kaleyra s.p.a. did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense in the three and nine months ended september 30, 2019 as there were no stock option plans in place during those periods. key business metrics revenue

revenue in the three months ended september 30, 2019, revenue increased by $11,705 thousand, compared to the same period of last year. on a combined basis, buc mobile and solutions infini revenue for the three months ended september 30, 2019 was $19,699 thousand, as compared to $10,156 thousand in the same period of last year, with an increase of $9,543 thousand, or 94%. kaleyra s.p.a.s operations in italy increased revenue by $2,334 thousand. this increase was primarily driven by an increase in the volume of messages and product mix, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange currency fluctuations of $226 thousand, or 1.9%. revenue increased slightly less than volume as a percentage due to a change in the mix of business products. cost of revenue and gross profit in the three months ended september 30, 2019, cost of revenue increased by $9,654 thousand, compared to the same period of last year. on a combined basis, solutions infini and buc mobiles cost of revenue was $15,697 thousand for the three months ended september 30, 2019, as compared to $7,923 thousand for the same period of last year, with an increase of $7,774 thousand, or 98%. this growth is slightly above the increase in revenue, strictly correlated. for kaleyra s.p.a., cost of revenue increased by $1,880 thousand compared with the same period of last year, in line with the growth in revenue. in the three months ended september 30, 2019, gross profit increased by $2,051 thousand, compared to the same period of last year. solutions infini and buc mobile, as on a combined basis, contributed $1,769 thousand of the increase, or 86%. the remaining increase of $282 thousand, was due to the expansion of kaleyra s.p.a.s operations in italy. the impact of the exchange rate variance in consolidated cost of revenue and gross profit was immaterial between three months ended 2019 and the same period of last year. operating expenses in the three months ended september 30, 2019, research and development expenses increased by $454 thousand, compared to the same period of last year, of which $314 thousand was due to the contribution of solutions infini and buc mobile. the remaining increase of $140 thousand was mainly a result of a decrease in capitalized software development costs, partially offset by a decrease in payroll expense. 11 in the three months ended september 30, 2019, sales and marketing expenses increased by $127 thousand, compared to the same period in 2018, of which $186 thousand was due to the contribution of solutions infini and buc mobile. this increase was offset by a decrease of $59 thousand as a result of a decrease in payroll expense, partially offset by higher advertising costs. in the three months ended september 30, 2019, general and administrative expenses increased by $150 thousand, compared to the same period of last year, of which $114 thousand was due the contribution of solutions infini and buc mobile. the remaining increase of $36 thousand was mainly a result of an increase in consulting expenses. in particular, in the three months ended september 30, 2019 general and administrative expenses included $1,140 thousand in non-recurring consulting fees primarily incurred in connection with the prospective business combination with gigcapital and related sec filings. in the three months ended september 30, 2018, general and administrative expenses included $772 thousand costs for consulting services specifically related to the solutions infini and buc mobile business acquisitions. excluding the above mentioned costs, general and administrative expenses would have decreased by $218 thousand compared to the same period of last year, mainly as a result of a decrease in payroll expense. financial expense, net in the three months ended september 30, 2019, financial expense, net decreased by $97 thousand, compared to the same period of last year. this decrease was primarily due to (i) a $195 thousand gain realized on derivatives in the three months ended september 30, 2019 compared to the estimated loss in the same period of last year, and (ii) an increase of interest expense of $76 thousand as a result of higher average borrowings and a $22 thousand increase in financial charges. foreign currency (income)/loss in the three months ended september 30, 2019 foreign currency loss was $260 thousand as compared to income of $252 thousand in the same period of last year. the change was mainly attributable to the effects of fluctuation of euro and indian rupee against the u.s. dollar. income tax expense in the three months ended september 30, 2019, income tax expense decreased by $561 thousand, compared to the same period of last year. as a percentage of (loss)/income before taxes, income tax expense increased principally as a result of (i) the recognition of taxes on undistributed profit from foreign subsidiaries in the three months ended september 30, 2019 (zero in the three months ended september 30, 2018), and (ii) the increase in the valuation allowance on tax loss carryforward compared to the same period of last year. 12 comparison of the nine months

primarily attributable to the consolidations of solutions infini occurring in june 2018 and buc mobile occurring in july 2018 and the growth experienced by both subsidiaries. on a combined basis, buc mobile and solutions infini revenue for the nine months ended september 30, 2019 was $50,358 thousand, as compared to $10,156 thousand for the same period of last year, with an increase of $40,202 thousand, 92% of the total increase or an increase of 396% for solutions infini and buc mobile compared to the same period in the prior year. this increase for solutions infini is primarily due to the effect of the consolidation for the entire nine-month period, and on a year over year comparison basis the increase from their prior year revenue is due to the expansion of the voice messaging volumes. the remaining increase of $3,693 thousand, or 9% from the same period in the prior year, was mainly attributable to an increase in kaleyra s.p.a.s message activity volume, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange currency fluctuations, of $2,670 thousand, or 6%, and a change in the business mix with a shift towards services with lower prices. cost of revenue and gross profit in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, cost of revenue increased by $34,982 thousand, compared to the same period of last year. the increase was primarily driven by higher message volumes, of which $31,718 thousand was due to the consolidation of solutions infini and buc mobile. the remaining increase of $3,264 thousand, or 10%, refers to the increase in kaleyra s.p.a. revenue compared to the same period of last year. in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, gross profit increased by $8,913 thousand, compared to same period of last year, of which $8,484 thousand was due to the consolidation of solutions infini and buc mobile. the remaining increase of $429 thousand, or 5%, was due to kaleyra s.p.a.s growth. at constant exchange rates, gross profit for the nine months ended september 30, 2019 (excluding the effects of the consolidation of solutions infini and buc mobile) would have increased by 12% compared to the same period of last year. 13 operating expenses in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, research and development expenses increased by $2,103 thousand, compared to the same period of last year, of which $1,736 thousand was due to the consolidation of solutions infini and buc mobile. the remaining increase of $367 thousand was mainly a result of an increase in software development costs for kaleyra s.p.a. in 2018, research and development expenses included capitalized costs of $380 thousand while in 2019 no research and development costs were capitalized. in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, sales and marketing expenses increased by $1,519 thousand compared to the same period of last year, of which $1,909 thousand was due to the consolidation of solutions infini and buc mobile. this increase was offset by a decrease of $390 thousand as no stock based compensation expense was recognized during the nine month period ended september 30, 2019 as there were not stock option plans in place. in addition, during the nine months ended september 30, 2019, no employee bonus expense was recorded, compared to $125 thousand in the same period of last year. in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, general and administrative expenses increased by $5,235 thousand compared to the same period of last year, of which $1,946 thousand was due to the consolidation of solutions infini and buc mobile. the remaining increase of $3,289 thousand was primarily a result of an increase in consulting and communications expense, partially offset by a reduction in payroll expense. in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, kaleyra s.p.a. incurred $3,803 thousand of non-recurring costs in connection with the prospective business combination with gigcapital and related sec filings. these expenses were offset by approximately $500 thousand in reduced payroll costs as no employee bonus expenses was recorded during the nine months ended september 30, 2019. financial expense, net in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, financial expense, net decreased by $307 thousand from the same period of last year. this decrease was mainly due to a $59 thousand decrease in financial expenses, as a result of a decrease in loss on derivatives, partially offset by an increase in interest expenses due to higher average borrowings and a $248 thousand increase in financial income, mainly due to an increase in gain on derivatives. foreign currency (income)/loss in the nine months ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, foreign currency loss/(income) were a $402 thousand loss and a $329 thousand income, respectively, resulting in a change of $731 thousand over the periods. such change was mainly attributable to the effects of fluctuation of euro and indian rupee against the u.s. dollar. income tax expense in the nine months ended september 30, 2019, income tax expense decreased by $122 thousand, compared to the same period of last year. in the nine months ended september 30, 2019 income tax expense decreased by 14.5 percentage points compared to the same period 2018. this decrease was principally attributable to (i) the increase in recognition of taxes on undistributed profit from foreign subsidiaries in the nine months ended september 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended september 30, 2018 and (ii) the decrease in the applicable tax rate for solutions infini that was reduced from 29.12% in 2018 to 25.17% in 2019. liquidity and capital resources as of september 30, 2019, kaleyra s.p.a. had $10.7 million of cash as compared to $8.2 million as of december 31, 2018. of the $10,700 thousand in cash, $8,700 thousand is held in italy, $1,900 thousand is held in india and $100 thousand is held in the united states. kaleyra s.p.a. also has marketable securities of $4,900 thousand of which $1,600 thousand is held in italy and $3,300 thousand is held in india. 14 the repatriation of money outside of italy may result in the cash being subject to certain taxes or other restrictions. management currently plans to retain the cash in the jurisdictions where these funds are currently held. kaleyra believes its cash, cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings will be sufficient to support its operations as currently configured for at least the next 12 months. kaleyra finances its operations through a combination of internally generated cash from operations and from borrowings under kaleyra bank facilities primarily with banks located in italy. kaleyras long-term cash needs include meeting debt service requirements, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. kaleyra may also pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that could impact its future cash requirements. there are a number of factors that may negatively impact its available sources of funds in the future including the ability to generate cash from operations, obtain additional financing or refinance existing short-term debt obligations, including those related to acquisitions completed in prior periods. the amount of cash generated from operations is dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of kaleyras business strategies and worldwide economic conditions. the amount of debt available under future financings is dependent on kaleyras ability to maintain adequate cash flow for debt service and sufficient collateral, and the general financial conditions in kaleyras market. kaleyra may seek to raise additional capital, subject to market and other conditions, through a combination of public or private equity offerings or debt financings to refinance its existing capital structure at a lower cost of capital and extend the maturity period of certain debt. additionally, kaleyra may also raise additional equity or debt capital for strategic opportunities which may include acquisitions of additional companies, and general corporate purpose. if kaleyra does raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. if kaleyra raises additional capital through debt financing, kaleyra may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional deb or making capital expenditures. if additional financing is required from outside sources, kaleyra may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to it or at all. if kaleyra is unable to raise additional capital when desired, kaleyras business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected and its ability to continue as a going concern will be impacted. kaleyra has a number of long-standing business and banking relationships with major italian commercial banks where it maintains both cash accounts and a credit relationship. historically kaleyra has used cash generated from operations to fund its growth and investment opportunities. as kaleyras management made the decision to expand its operations outside of italy and acquired additional companies it took on certain additional financing in order to fund cash payments due on the acquisitions. as of september 30, 2019, kaleyras total bank and other borrowings, including amounts drawn under the revolving credit line facilities was $26,800 thousand. total bank and other borrowings as of december 31, 2018 were $13,800 thousand. kaleyra has credit line facilities of $5,603 thousand as of september 30, 2019, of which $1,634 thousand was outstanding. as of december 31, 2018, kaleyra had credit line facilities of $4,624 thousand, of which $1,648 thousand was outstanding. amounts drawn under the credit line facilities are secured by kaleyras customer accounts receivables and funds available under the line are limited based on eligible receivables. 15 long-term financial obligations, excluding

generated from operations, and borrowings under credit facilities. kaleyras management regularly monitors certain liquidity measures to monitor performance. 16 in 2017 and 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. entered into agreements to acquire solutions infini and buc mobile. the terms of both acquisitions included cash payments as of the respective acquisition date and deferred payments to the selling shareholders due in 2019 and 2020. in july 2019 kaleyra s.p.a. paid a combined total of $9,097 thousand due under both purchase agreements. there are no remaining obligations under the buc mobile stock purchase agreement. kaleyra s.p.a. has a remaining obligation under the purchase agreement with solutions infini in the amount of $2,438 thousand as of september 30, 2019 with payment due in july 2020 related to the preference shares assigned to certain former shareholders of solutions infini. the base purchase price payable as consideration for all of the shares of solutions infini was equal to inr 1,025,050 thousand, subject to variations if solutions infini reached targeted levels of ebitda and net financial position for the years ending march 31, 2018 and a target level of ebitda for the year ending march 31, 2019. as mentioned above, kaleyra s.p.a. acquired all the shares of solutions infini in different stages and with multiples payments. in accordance with the purchase agreement, kaleyra s.p.a. paid $8,083 thousand in 2017, and in july 2018 paid $6,602 thousand. in july 2019 kaleyra s.p.a. paid $5,097 thousand (including $770 thousand originally due in july 2020). as mentioned above, the purchase price for the buc mobile acquisition is an aggregate sum of $6,286 thousand payable as consideration for all of the shares of buc mobile to be paid in cash in three different installments, specifically: $2,286 thousand was paid in cash on july 31, 2018, $2,000 thousand was paid on july 31, 2019, and the final installment of $2,000 thousand originally due in july 2020, was paid in advance on july 31, 2019. there are no further obligations due under the buc mobile purchase agreement. as part of the transaction, kaleyra s.p.a. provided letters of credit to secure the future payments due to the selling shareholders. all letters of credit outstanding were cancelled upon payment in full of the final installments due under the agreement. in april 2019 kaleyra s.p.a. entered into three additional long-term financing as follows:  a long-term financing with ubi banca s.p.a. denominated in euro for a total amount of 2,000 thousand ($2,289 thousand at

rate (euribor 3 months plus 2.6% spread). the total amount was drawn in full on the same date. proceeds were primarily used to settle the remaining deferred consideration due for the acquisition of buc mobile, and all amounts due under the purchase agreement were paid in full on july 31, 2019. the outstanding letters of credit were cancelled. 17 finally, in august 2019, kaleyra s.p.a. entered

(1) in july 2019, kaleyra s.p.a. entered into a medium-term financing agreement with banco popolare di milano s.p.a. denominated in euro for a total of 4,000 thousand ($4,548 thousand at the september 30, 2019 exchange rate) to be repaid in 8 quarterly installments. the financing has a maturity of 24 months from the date of disbursement and bears interest at a variable rate (euribor 3 months plus 2.0% spread). the total amount was drawn in full on the same date and proceeds were used to settle the total deferred consideration for the acquisition of solutions infini. (2) in july 2019 kaleyra s.p.a. entered into a medium-term financing agreement with intesa sanpaolo s.p.a. denominated in euro, for a total notional amount of 4,000 thousand ($4,548 thousand at the september 30, 2019 exchange rate) to be repaid in 16 quarterly installments. the financing has a maturity of 48 months from the date of disbursement and bears interest at a variable rate (euribor 3 months plus 2.6% spread). the total amount was drawn in full on the same date. proceeds will be primarily used to settle the remaining deferred consideration due for the acquisition of buc mobile. (3) in august 2019 kaleyra s.p.a. entered into a medium-term financing agreement with unicredit s.p.a. denominated in euro for a total of 2,500 thousand ($2,843 thousand at the september 30, 2019 exchange rate) to be repaid in quarterly installments starting from february 2020. the financing will bear interest at a variable rate (euribor 3 months plus 3.9% spread). the notional amount was fully drawn on the same date. (4) in april 2019 kaleyra s.p.a. entered into three additional long-term financing as follows:  a long-term financing with ubi banca s.p.a. denominated in euro for a total amount of 2,000 thousand ($2,289 thousand at the december 31, 2018 exchange rate) fully drawn and with maturity april 2021;  a long-term financing with monte dei paschi di siena s.p.a. denominated in euro for a total of 600 thousand ($687 thousand at the december 31, 2018 exchange rate) fully drawn and with maturity april 2022;  a long-term financing with banco popolare di milano s.p.a. denominated in euro for a total of 1,200 thousand ($1,374 thousand at the december 31, 2018 exchange rate) fully drawn and with maturity june 2023. (5) in july 2019 kaleyra s.p.a. signed an amendment to the solutions infini purchase agreement based on which the fourth closing date has been anticipated at the same date of the third closing date (july 2019). 19 off-balance sheet arrangements during the three and the nine months ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. did not have any relationships with any entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purposes entities established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other purposes. seasonality kaleyras results are affected by the business cycles of its customer base, which generally results in stronger revenue in the fourth quarter of the financial year. kaleyra believes this variability is largely due to the markets demand for its customers and/or business partners services due to higher levels of purchasing activity in the holiday season. as a result of its historically higher portion of sales in the fourth quarter of each year, its cost of revenue increases during such period relative to any increase in revenue. the increase in cost of revenue and other impacts of seasonality may affect profitability in a given quarter. taxes kaleyra s.p.a. files income tax returns in italy and in foreign jurisdictions including india, the united states and switzerland. for the nine months ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, kaleyra s.p.a.s consolidated effective tax rate was negative 62.5% and 146.8%, respectively. the decrease for the nine months in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of costs non-deductible for tax purposes, such as stock-based compensation expenses and other non-cash compensation expenses. for the three months ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rates were negative 17% and 536%, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate is mainly due to recognition of taxes on undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. at this time kaleyra intends to indefinitely reinvest part of these earnings in the subsidiary to fund the international operations and certain obligations of the subsidiary. in addition, kaleyra expects future cash generated from its operations in europe and the u.s. to be sufficient to meet kaleyras future cash needs. should the remaining undistributed earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the distributions would result in $765 thousand amount of tax, as of september 30, 2019. as of december 31, 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. had $7,217 thousand in net operating loss carryforwards, of which $5,763 thousand originated in united states and $1,454 thousand originated in switzerland. if not utilized, the net operating losses originating in united states will expire at various dates from 2033 through 2038, while the net operating losses originating in switzerland will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2025. critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap applicable for an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act. the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. in particular, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would apply to private companies. for the purpose of these consolidated financial statements, kaleyra availed itself of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, did not adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies. preparation of these financial statements requires kaleyra to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. kaleyra bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable. in many instances, kaleyra could have reasonably used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. actual results could differ significantly from the estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. 20 kaleyra believes that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding the historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving the judgments and estimates. revenue recognition kaleyra derives revenue primarily from usage-based fees earned from the sale of communications services offered through software solutions to large enterprises, as well as small and medium-sized customers. revenue can be billed in advance or in arrears depending on the terms of the agreement; for the majority of customers revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis in arrears. amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in revenue or deferred revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria has been met. kaleyra recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are satisfied:  the service has been or is being rendered to the customer;  the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and  collectability of the fees is reasonably assured. collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including payment history and the creditworthiness of a customer. if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. the contracts do not provide customers and business partners with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications. as a part of the arrangement with its customers and business partners, kaleyra offers customers advanced support services to guarantee the continuity and promptly delivery of the services. revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the term of the service period. the contractual arrangements do not contain general rights of return. sales and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue. stock-based compensation as mentioned above, in january 2018, kaleyra s.p.a. adopted a stock-based compensation plan with an original vesting period of three years. in november 2018, the kaleyra s.p.a. board of directors resolved to amend the original terms of this plan, substantially accelerating the vesting of the awarded stock options and granting to the plans beneficiaries the right to exercise all of the stock options awarded and not previously exercised, either vested or unvested, regardless of the fulfilment of any performance conditions, provided, in any case, that the beneficiary was employed by kaleyra s.p.a. or any of its subsidiaries as of the exercise date. as of december 31, 2018, all of the stock options awarded were exercised. stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $ 7,359 thousand. the incremental compensation cost expense resulting from the plans modification was equal to $5,735 thousand. kaleyra accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. 21 determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. kaleyra used the cox-rubinstein binomial tree valuation model, a multi-period market model, to measure the fair value of its stock options. all forfeitures were accounted for as they occurred. the identified model requires the use of objective and subjective assumptions, which determine the fair-value of stock-based awards. these assumptions include:  fair value of common stock. the fair value of the shares of kaleyra s.p.a.s common stock underlying stock options is established by the board of directors on the basis of various objective and subjective factors including but not limited to, the following: i) kaleyra s.p.a.s results of operations, financial position and capital resource; ii) current business conditions and projections; iii) the lack of marketability of kaleyra s.p.a.s common stock; iv) the hiring of key personnel and the experience of kaleyra s.p.a.s management; v) the introduction of new products; vi) the risk inherent in the development and expansion of kaleyra s.p.a.s products; vii) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as a sale of kaleyra; viii) industry trends and competitive environment; and ix) overall economic indicators, including gross domestic product, employment, inflation and interest rates.  expected term. the expected term was estimated to be the final maturity date of the option (i.e., the last day allowed for the exercise). this assumption is confirmed by the model behavior that implies that, in the absence of dividends, the optimal exercise time of a stock option is the final maturity date.  expected volatility. the expected volatility is derived from an average of the historical volatilities of the common stock of several entities with characteristics similar to those of kaleyra s.p.a., such as the size, and operational and economic similarities to its principle business operations. kaleyra uses this method because it has limited information on the volatility of its common stock.  risk-free interest rate. the risk-free interest rate is based on the rates of the euro swap curve with maturities similar to the expected term of the options as of the grant date.  expected dividends. the expected dividend is assumed to be zero, as kaleyra s.p.a. has never paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on its common stock. in evaluating stock options, kaleyra s.p.a.s board of directors has been assisted by an independent third-party specialist. during 2019, kaleyra s.p.a. had no stock option plans in place; therefore, kaleyra s.p.a. has not reported any expense for stock-based compensation expense in the three and nine months ended september 30, 2019. internal-use software development costs certain costs of the technology platform and other software applications developed for internal use are capitalized. kaleyra capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs that are incurred during the application development stage. capitalization of costs begins when two criteria are met: (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, and (ii) it is probable that the software will be completed and used for its intended purpose. capitalization ceases when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all-significant testing. costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements are also capitalized when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. any costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed. costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operating activities are expensed as incurred. 22 capitalized costs of the platform and other software applications are included in property and equipment. these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software on a straight-line basis over four years. management evaluates the useful life of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could affect the recoverability of these assets. the amortization of costs related to the platform applications is included in cost of revenue, while the amortization of costs related to other software applications developed for internal use is included in research and development expenses. kaleyra exercises judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. to the extent that there is a change the manner in which kaleyra develops and tests new features and functionalities related to the kaleyra platform, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of internal-use software development costs capitalized and amortized could change in future periods. impairment of long-lived assets kaleyra evaluates long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. if such evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or the asset group is not recoverable, any impairment loss would be equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value. there was no impairment during the three and nine months ended september 30, 2019 and 2018. recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this current report on form 8-k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors include international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond kaleyras control. interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. kaleyras interest rates on the bank borrowing held by italian commercial banks is at market in italy and well below market in other geographical locations. therefore, kaleyra does not believe there is material exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt. foreign currency risk kaleyra s.p.a.s consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars while the functional currency of kaleyra is the euro. the functional currency of solutions infini is the indian rupee and the functional currency of buc mobile is u.s. dollar. the local currencies of kaleyras foreign subsidiaries are the euro, indian rupee, u.s. dollar, united arab emirates dirhams, swiss francs and the singapore dollar. each company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other that its functional currency at period-end exchange rates and non-monetary items are remeasured at historical rates. remeasurement adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as foreign currency (income) in the period of occurrence. 23 for legal entities where the functional currency is a currency other than the u.s. dollar, including kaleyra, adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements into u.s. dollar are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive

paid out of gigcapitals trust account, which after taking into account the redemptions, had a balance immediately prior to the closing of approximately $40.8 million. in addition, approximately $14,000 remained in gigcapitals operating account immediately prior to the closing. off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of september 30, 2019, gigcapital had not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. gigcapital did not participate in transactions that created relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. gigcapital did not enter into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, establish any special purpose entities, guaranty any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchase any non-financial assets. contractual obligations as of september 30, 2019, gigcapital did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay its sponsor a monthly fee of $20,000 for office space, administrative services and secretarial support. gigcapital began incurring these fees on december 8, 2017 and continued to incur these fees monthly until the completion of the business combination. on september 27, 2019, gigcapital and greenhaven road capital fund 1, lp, a delaware limited partnership (greenhaven fund 1), and greenhaven road capital fund 2, lp, a delaware limited partnership (greenhaven fund 2 and together with greenhaven fund 1, greenhaven) entered into a forward share purchase agreement (the greenhaven purchase agreement) pursuant to which gigcapital agreed to purchase the shares of common stock of gigcapital into which rights of gigcapital held by greenhaven and any additional rights that greenhaven will acquire will convert into upon the closing of the business combination at the following price: (1) $1.05 per right for the first 5,500,000 rights (which reflects $10.50 per share for the first 550,000 shares); (2) $1.07 per right for the next 2,500,000 rights (which reflects $10.70 per share for the next 250,000 shares); and (3) $1.10 per right for the next 2,000,000 rights (which reflects $11.00 per share for the next 200,000 shares). gigcapital agreed to purchase the shares on the later of the sixtieth day after the closing of the business combination or january 1, 2020 (the greenhaven purchase closing date). in exchange for gigcapitals commitment to acquire the shares on the greenhaven purchase closing date, each of greenhaven fund 1 and greenhaven fund 2 agreed to continue to hold, and not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or hedge (including any transactions involving any derivative securities of gigcapital and including any short sales (as defined below) involving any of gigcapitals securities), the rights (including any additional rights) held by greenhaven, and any shares that such rights (including any additional rights) convert into, until the greenhaven purchase closing date, including not to tender the rights (or any additional rights) to gigcapital in response to any tender offer that gigcapital may commence for the rights. for purposes of the greenhaven purchase agreement, short sales include, without limitation, all short sales as defined in rule 200 promulgated under regulation sho under the securities and exchange act of 1934 (the exchange act), whether or not against the box, and all types of direct and indirect stock pledges, forward sales contracts, options, puts, calls, short sales, swaps, put equivalent positions (as defined in rule 16a-1(h) under the exchange act) and similar arrangements (including on a total return basis), and sales and other transactions through non-u.s. broker dealers or foreign regulated brokers. notwithstanding the forgoing, the parties agreed that greenhaven shall after the closing of the business combination have the right but not the obligation to sell any or all of its shares issued for the rights into in the open market if the share price equals or exceeds $10.50 per share. furthermore, the parties agreed that nothing in the greenhaven purchase agreement shall prohibit greenhaven from entering into a contract to purchase and/or sell warrants of gigcapital. no amount was recorded in the financial statements as the amount of the liability is not considered probable or reasonably estimable as it is dependent on the number of additional rights subsequently purchased by greenhaven, as well as the number of shares sold by greenhaven after the business combination should the market price of the stock increase above the $10.50 price limitation, as it did in november 2019. 26 critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. actual results could materially differ from those estimates. the gigcapital identified the following critical accounting policies: emerging growth company section 102(b)(1) of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a securities act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the exchange act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. gigcapital elected not to opt out of such extended transition period. net loss per common share net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. gigcapital applied the two-class method in calculating the net loss per common share. shares of common stock subject to possible redemption as of september 30, 2019 and 2018, have been excluded from the calculation of the basic net loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the trust account earnings. the company did not considered the effect of (1) warrants included in the units sold in the offering and the sale of the private placement units to purchase an aggregate of 11,154,942 shares of common stock since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon future events, (2) rights included in the units sold in the offering and the sale of the private placement units that convert into 1,487,326 shares of common stock since the conversion of the rights is contingent upon future events and (3) the 60,000 shares of common stock underlying restricted stock awards that are still subject to forfeiture as of september 30, 2019 and 2018. since the company was in an adjusted net loss position during the periods presented within, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share for all periods presented. in accordance with the two-class method, the companys net income (loss) is adjusted to remove net income that is attributable to common stock subject to redemption, as these shares only participate in the income of the trust account and not the losses of the company. accordingly, net loss per common share, basic and diluted, is calculated as follows: year ended september 30, period from october 9, 2017 (date ofinception) throughseptember 30, 2019 2018 net loss $ (1,086,138 ) $ (665,385 ) less: net income attributable to common stock subject to redemption (1,169,705 ) (941,036 ) adjusted net loss $ (2,255,843 ) $ (1,606,421 ) weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 4,207,008 4,048,626 net loss per share common share, basic and diluted $ (0.54 ) $ (0.40 ) 27 common stock subject to possible redemption gigcapital accounted for its common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification (asc) topic 480 distinguishing liabilities from equity. common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. at all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. gigcapitals common stock featured certain redemption rights that were considered to be outside of its control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. accordingly, as of september 30, 2019 and 2018, the common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet. recent accounting pronouncements gigcapital did not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on its financial statements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. gigcapitals efforts were limited to organizational activities and activities relating to the offering and the identification and evaluation of a potential initial business combination, including the business combination. gigcapital neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues. at september 30, 2019, the net proceeds from gigcapitals offering held in the trust account was comprised entirely of money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule 2a-7 under the investment company act, which invest solely in united states treasuries. due to the short-term nature of the money market funds investments, gigcapital did not believe that there would be an associated material exposure to interest rate risk. as of september 30, 2019, $78,757,615 was held in the trust account for the purposes of consummating the business combination. properties the facilities of kaleyra are described in the proxy statement in the section titled information about kaleyra  facilities and is incorporated

investments limited, a company formed under the laws of england (maya), hong kong permanent shine limited, a company formed under the laws of hong kong, ipai terry hsiao, giacomo dallaglio, alex milani, luca giardina papa, filippo monastra, matteo castelucci, kirk tsai, justyna miziolek, erjon metko, claudio ippolito, andrea riccardi, and francesco vizzone. pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, the sellers will sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to the buyer all of the company stock (the transaction). defined terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the purchase agreement previously filed as exhibit 2.1 to the february current report, as previously amended by amendment no. 1 to the purchase agreement dated september 24, 2019, as filed with the sec on september 24, 2019 (the first amendment). as disclosed in the february current report, in accordance with, and subject to the purchase agreement, each company stockholder will be entitled to receive his, her or its share, as specified in the purchase agreement, of the aggregate closing consideration to be paid to the company stockholders at the closing (the aggregate closing consideration), in addition to a contingent right to receive the earnout shares (as defined and further described below under the heading earnout shares). the

notes) for a specified principal amount (the note principal amount). each of esse effe and maya will receive its portion of the aggregate closing consideration in the form of a combination of closing share consideration, cash consideration and notes. each of the other company stockholders will receive his, her or its portion of the aggregate closing consideration solely in the form of closing share consideration. the aggregate value of each component of the aggregate closing consideration will be determined by the percentage of the offering shares (as defined in the buyers amended and restated certificate of incorporation dated december 7, 2017 (the certificate of incorporation) attached as exhibit 3.1 to the current report on form 8-k as filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the sec) on december 12, 2017) outstanding as of february 22, 2019 that have been redeemed prior to the closing (the redemption percentage) pursuant to the redemption rights (as defined in the certificate of incorporation) and article ix of the buyer certificate of incorporation. the purchase agreement apportions each component of the aggregate closing consideration according to five fixed ranges of possible redemption percentages (the redemption ranges). as described more fully below, the redemption range that has occurred with regard to the transaction is the redemption range of a redemption percentage that is greater than 62.5% but less than or equal to 75.0%. as a result, the aggregate cash consideration to be paid to esse effe and maya under the terms of the purchase agreement is $7,500,000. on november 23, 2019, the buyer, company, sellers, and the seller representative entered into amendment no. 2 to the purchase agreement (the second amendment). the second amendment provides that in lieu of the buyer paying aggregate cash consideration to esse effe and maya in the amount of $7,500,000, buyer will issue unsecured promissory notes to each of esse effe and maya, in the amounts of $6,000,000 and $1,500,000 respectively, (the cash consideration notes) at the closing. the second amendment also provides that the funds in the buyers trust account, after taking into account payments for the redemptions, will be used to pay unpaid expenses. interest on the cash consideration notes will accrue at a fixed interest rate equal to the one-year u.s. dollar libor interest rate published in the wall street journal on the closing date, which is one and ninety-one hundredths percent (1.09%), plus a margin of one percent (1%) per annum. all interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. the outstanding principal balance of the cash consideration notes, plus all accrued and unpaid interest and fees due under the cash consideration notes, shall, upon the receipt by the buyer, whether in a debt or equity financing event by the buyer (which may include the receipt of cash from third parties with which the buyer has entered into forward share purchase agreements), of cash proceeds in an amount not less than eleven million five hundred thousand dollars ($11,500,000.00) (the financing proceeds), be due and payable no later than ten business days after buyer receives the financing proceeds. a copy of the form of cash consideration notes is attached as an exhibit to the second amendment, a copy of which is filed with this current report on form 8-k as exhibit 2.3 and is incorporated herein by reference. except as expressly modified by the first amendment and the second amendment, the purchase agreement remains in full force and effect in all respects. this section describes the material provisions the amendment and the cash consideration notes but does not purport to describe all of their terms. the foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the second amendment and the form of cash consideration note, a copy of which is attached as exhibit 2.3, and are incorporated herein by reference. the purchase agreement, the first amendment, the second amendment and the form of cash consideration note are included as an exhibit or incorporated by reference into this current report on form 8-k in order to provide investors and security holders with material information regarding its terms and the transaction. it is not intended to provide any other factual information about the buyer, company or the other parties to the purchase agreement or the amendment. in particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties by the buyer and company contained in the purchase agreement are qualified by information in the disclosure schedules provided by the buyer and company in connection with the signing of the purchase agreement. these disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the purchase agreement. moreover, certain representations and warranties in the purchase agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the buyer and company, rather than establishing matters as facts. accordingly, investors and security holders should not rely on the representations and warranties in the purchase agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the buyer or company. amendments to extension notes and working capital notes as previously disclosed in its current report on form 8-k as filed with the sec on march 8, 2019 (the march current report), the buyer on march 6, 2019, issued an unsecured promissory note (the initial extension note) in the principal amount of $1,046,044.70 to gigacquisitions, llc, a delaware limited liability

further extending the period of time for the buyer to consummate a business combination (the november extension note). each of the july extension note, november extension note, july working capital note and october working capital note bear no interest and are repayable in full upon the closing. furthermore, each of the july working capital note and the october working capital note are convertible at the payees election upon the closing. upon such election, the july working capital note and the october working capital note will convert, at a price of $10.00 per unit, into units identical to the private placement units issued in connection with the buyers initial public offering. in lieu of repaying in full upon the closing, the initial extension note, the july extension

extension notes and amended working capital notes, shall, upon the receipt by the buyer, whether in a debt or equity financing event by the buyer (which may include the receipt of cash from third parties with which the buyer has entered into forward share purchase agreements), the financing proceeds, be due and payable no later than ten business days after buyer receives the financing proceeds. interest on the amended extension notes and amended working capital notes will accrue at a fixed interest rate equal to the one-year u.s. dollar libor interest rate published in the wall street journal on the closing date, which is one and ninety-one hundredths percent (1.09%), plus a margin of one percent (1%) per annum. all interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. none of the amended extension notes or amended working capital notes will be convertible into securities of the buyer. the buyer has on november 23, 2019 issued the amended extension notes and amended working capital notes to gigacquisitions and gigfounders, as appropriate, for each of the initial extension note, the july extension note, november extension note, july working capital note and october working capital note. copies of the forms of amended extension note and amended working capital note are filed as exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and

(kaleyra, which term also refers to the post-combination delaware corporation, as gigcapital intends to change its name to kaleyra, inc., upon the closing of the business combination). on november 19, 2019, gigcapital and glazer entered into a forward share purchase agreement (the glazer purchase agreement) pursuant to which glazer may elect to sell and transfer to kaleyra, and kaleyra will purchase the glazer shares at a price of $10.68 per share (the glazer shares purchase price). glazer shall notify kaleyra in writing five business days prior to the six month anniversary of the business combination closing date (as defined below) if it is not exercising its right to sell the glazer shares to kaleyra; otherwise, absent written notification to the contrary, glazer shall be deemed to have exercised its right to sell all of its glazer shares to kaleyra. kaleyra will purchase the glazer shares from glazer on the six month anniversary of the closing of the business combination (the glazer shares closing date). as of november 11, 2019, glazer held 922,933 shares of common stock and could acquire up to an additional 77,067 shares of common stock. in exchange for kaleyras commitment to purchase the glazer shares on the glazer shares closing date, glazer agreed to continue to hold, and not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or hedge (including any transactions involving any derivative securities of kaleyra and any short sales (as defined below) involving any of gigcapital and kaleyras securities) the glazer shares prior to the six (6) month anniversary of the date of the closing of the business combination (the business combination closing date). glazer further agreed that it will not redeem any of the glazer shares in conjunction with gigcapitals stockholders approval of the business combination. short sales include, without limitation, all short sales as defined in rule 200 promulgated under regulation sho under the securities and exchange act of 1934 (the exchange act), whether or not against the box, and all types of direct and indirect stock pledges,

basis), and sales and other transactions through non-u.s. broker dealers or foreign regulated brokers. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, commencing on the day after the business combination closing date, glazer may sell the glazer shares in the open market as long as the sales price is above $10.50 per glazer share. simultaneously with the closing of the business combination, kaleyra will deposit $10.68 million (or such lesser amount as is equal to $10.68 multiplied by the number of glazer shares held by glazer at the business combination closing date), the aggregate amount necessary to purchase the glazer shares, into an escrow account with continental stock transfer and trust company (the escrow agent), subject to the terms of an escrow agreement. kaleyras purchase of the glazer shares will be made with funds from the escrow account attributed to the glazer shares. in the event that glazer sells any glazer shares as provided for above, it shall provide notice to kaleyra within three business days of such sale, and glazer shall instruct the escrow agent to release from the escrow account for kaleyras use without restriction an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the escrow attributed to the glazer shares which glazer has sold. in the event that glazer chooses not to sell to kaleyra any glazer shares that it owns as of the six month anniversary of the business combination closing date, glazer shall instruct the escrow agent to release all remaining funds from the escrow account for kaleyras use without restriction. notwithstanding kaleyras commitment to deposit up to $10.68 million in escrow account for the purchase of the glazer shares, gigcapital shall use its best efforts to enter into a letter of credit agreement for the issuance of a standby letter of credit for the benefit of glazer with bank of america or another bank acceptable to glazer (the issuing bank) as soon as possible to replace the escrow account. if the letter of credit agreement is entered into prior or simultaneously with the closing of the business combination, kaleyra will deposit the $10.68 million (or such lesser amount as is equal to $10.68 multiplied by the number of glazer shares held by glazer at the business combination closing date) into a collateral account with the issuing bank in lieu of depositing it into an escrow account with the escrow agent. if the letter of credit agreement is entered into after the closing of the business combination, glazer will instruct the escrow agent to deposit the funds held in the escrow account into the collateral account with the issuing bank. concurrently with the execution of the letter of credit agreement, the issuing bank shall issue the letter of credit for the benefit of glazer in the amount of $10,680,000 (or such lesser amount as is equal to $10.68 multiplied by the number of glazer shares held by glazer at the business combination closing date). glazer shall drawdown from the letter of credit to satisfy the payment due to glazer by kaleyra for the purchase of the glazer shares. in the event that glazer sells any glazer shares pursuant to the sales price restriction set forth above, it shall provide notice to kaleyra and the issuing bank within three business days of such sale, and the issuing bank shall release from the collateral account an amount equal to the number of glazer shares sold multiplied by $10.68 to kaleyra for kaleyras use without restriction, with a corresponding reduction in the amount of the letter of credit. in the event that glazer elects not to sell to kaleyra any glazer shares, the issuing bank shall release all funds in the collateral account to kaleyra for kaleyras use without restriction and terminate the letter of credit. nothing in the glazer purchase agreement prohibits or restricts glazer with respect to the purchase or sale of gigcapital warrants. the glazer purchase agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants from the parties. gigcapitals obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the glazer purchase agreement is subject to the consummation of the business combination. the glazer purchase agreement may be terminated: (i) by mutual written consent of gigcapital and glazer; and (ii) automatically if gigcapitals stockholders fail to approve the business combination. the foregoing description is only a summary of the glazer purchase agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the glazer purchase agreement, which is filed as exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. the glazer purchase agreement is included as an exhibit to this current report on form 8-k in order to provide investors and security holders with material information regarding its terms and the transaction. it is not intended to provide any other factual information about gigcapital or glazer. the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the glazer purchase agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement; are solely for the benefit of the parties to the glazer purchase agreement; may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the glazer purchase agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ from those applicable to investors. investors should not rely on the representations, warranties or covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of gigcapital or glazer. forward share purchase agreement with yakira capital management, inc. on november 19, 2019, gigcapital and yakira

gigcapital and kaleyras securities), and any shares of common stock that the rights of gigcapital convert into, until the rights shares closing date, than those agreed to between gigcapital and yakira in the yakira purchase agreement. if gigcapital does enter into such an agreement as described in the previous sentence, it will immediately notify yakira and offer the same terms to yakira. yakira has the right to terminate the agreement for kaleyra to purchase the rights shares, without penalty, commencing on the thirtieth day after the business combination closing date and ending on the day prior to the rights shares closing date, by giving written notice to kaleyra, in which case it will not be restricted after such time with respect to its ability to dispose of the rights shares (subject to the restrictions against transactions involving any derivative securities of kaleyra and any short sales involving any of gigcapital and kaleyras securities). yakira shares except as described below, yakira agreed to continue to hold, and not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or hedge (including any transactions involving any derivative securities of kaleyra and any short sales (as defined below) involving any of gigcapital and kaleyras securities) the yakira shares prior to the six month anniversary of the business combination closing date. yakira further agreed to not redeem any of the yakira shares in conjunction with gigcapitals stockholders approval of the business combination. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, commencing on the day after the business combination closing date, yakira may sell the yakira shares in the open market as long as the sales price is above $10.50 per yakira share. if yakira still owns yakira shares as of the four month anniversary of the business combination closing date, yakira may sell such yakira shares between the four month anniversary and six month anniversary of the business combination closing date to kaleyra for a per share price (the yakira shares purchase price) equal to (a) the per share redemption amount of a share of common stock of gigcapital in connection with gigcapitals stockholders approval of the business combination, plus (b) $0.03 per share for each month (prorated for a partial month) following the business combination closing date that yakira has held the yakira shares. the closing of the sale of the yakira shares to kaleyra shall occur on the business day following kaleyras receipt of the yakira shares exercise notice (the yakira shares closing date). on the yakira shares closing date, yakira shall deliver the yakira shares to kaleyra against receipt of the aggregate yakira shares purchase price, which shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the escrow account described below. yakira may instruct the escrow agent to release to yakira an amount equal to the shares purchase price multiplied by the number of yakira shares delivered to kaleyra from the escrow account on the shares closing date for yakiras use without restriction. following the closing of the business combination, kaleyra will deposit into an escrow account with the escrow agent, subject to an escrow agreement, with a nationally chartered bank the amount of $10.68 per share multiplied by the number of yakira shares held by yakira as of the business combination closing date. kaleyras purchase of the yakira shares will be made with funds from the escrow account attributed to the yakira shares. in the event that yakira sells any yakira shares as provided for above, it shall provide notice to kaleyra within three business days of such sale, and kaleyra may promptly release from the escrow account for its use without restriction an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the escrow account attributed to the yakira shares which yakira has sold. in the event that yakira chooses not to sell to kaleyra any yakira shares that it owns as of the six month anniversary of the business combination closing date, kaleyra may promptly release all remaining funds from the escrow account for its use without restriction. in the event that the yakira shares purchase price paid on the yakira shares closing date is less than $10.68 per yakira share, following payment of the yakira shares purchase price to yakira, kaleyra and yakira shall deliver joint written instructions to the escrow agent to release to kaleyra from the remaining funds in the escrow account an amount equal to the difference between the yakira shares purchase price and $10.68 per share multiplied by the number of yakira shares delivered by yakira, and the escrow agent shall promptly disburse such amount to kaleyra in accordance with the payment instructions. general terms nothing in the yakira purchase agreement prohibits or restricts yakira with respect to the purchase or sale of gigcapital warrants. the yakira purchase agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants from the parties. each partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the yakira purchase agreement is subject to the consummation of the business combination. in addition to yakiras separate termination right described above, the yakira purchase agreement may be terminated: (i) by mutual written consent of gigcapital and yakira; and (ii) automatically if gigcapitals stockholders fail to approve the business combination. the foregoing description is only a summary of the yakira purchase agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the yakira purchase agreement, which is filed as exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. the yakira purchase agreement is included as an exhibit to this current report on form 8 k in order to provide investors and security holders with material information regarding its terms and the transaction. it is not intended to provide any other factual information about gigcapital or yakira. the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the yakira purchase agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement; are solely for the benefit of the parties to the yakira purchase agreement; may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the yakira purchase agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ from those applicable to investors. investors should not rely on the representations, warranties or covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of gigcapital or yakira. forward-looking statements this current report on form 8-k may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 regarding the transactions described above, the business combination, the company and kaleyra. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that the company and/or kaleyra expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements and are identified with, but not limited to, words such as believe

business plans of the company and kaleyra management teams. in addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. these statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the management of the company and/or kaleyra in light of their respective experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments and their potential effects on the company and kaleyra as well as other factors they believe are appropriate in the circumstances. there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company or kaleyra will be those anticipated and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in this press release due to many factors such as, but not limited to, the ability to satisfy closing conditions for the business combination, including that the company stockholders will approve the business combination, the ability of the combined company to meet the nyses listing standards, and that the company will have sufficient capital upon the approval of the business combination to operate as anticipated. should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the assumptions being made prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. these statements speak only as of the date they are made and none of the company and/or kaleyra undertakes any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances which arise after the date of this current report on form 8-k. no offer or solicitation this current

shares), which shall be no more than 2,000,000 shares. after the closing of the business combination, ngfp may sell the subject shares at its sole discretion in one or more transactions, publicly or privately, at any time prior to the original valuation date or extended valuation date (each as defined below, and each a valuation date) at a price per subject share not less than the forward price. any subject shares sold by ngfp during the term of the transaction will cease to be subject shares. ngfp will give written notice to kaleyra of any sale of subject shares by ngfp within two business days of the date of such sale, such notice to include the date of the sale, the number of subject shares sold, and confirmation that the sale price per subject share was not less than the forward price. after the closing of the business combination, ngfp may also buy and sell additional shares for its own account or on behalf of third parties, and the pricing limitation set forth in the prior paragraph will not apply to any shares purchased after the closing of the business combination. on each quarterly anniversary of the closing of the business combination (any such date, a cash settlement date), ngfp will terminate the transaction in whole or in part by reducing the number of subject shares for the transaction (the reduction being terminated shares). the number of terminated shares with respect to any cash settlement date will equal the number of subject shares sold by ngfp since the prior cash settlement date (or with respect to the first cash settlement date, the closing of the business combination). ngfp will notify kaleyra of the expected number of terminated shares not less than ten days prior to the applicable cash settlement date. on each cash settlement date, ngfp will pay kaleyra an amount equal to the product of (a) the number of terminated shares and (b) the forward price. with effect from the cash settlement date, the remaining number of subject shares for the transaction will be reduced by the terminated shares. the original valuation date for the transaction will be the first anniversary of the closing of the business combination, provided that ngfp and kaleyra may, not later than ten days prior to the original valuation date, agree, each in their sole discretion, to extend the valuation date to the second anniversary of the business combination (the extended valuation date). at the original valuation date or extended valuation date, the transaction will be settled by ngfp delivering the remaining subject shares to kaleyra, and kaleyra paying ngfp an amount equal to the product of (x) the forward price, (y) the applicable accrual percentage (as defined below), and (z) the number of remaining subject shares. the accrual percentage is the product of (a) with respect to any settlement occurring on or before the original valuation date, 2.75% per annum, and with respect to any settlement occurring after the original valuation date, 3.50% per annum, and (b) the number of actual days divided by the number of days in a year beginning on the date of the closing of the business combination and ending on the applicable day of the settlement. the confirmation contains standard and customary representations and warranties for an agreement of this nature. an affiliate of nomura, nomura holdings, inc., is providing a guarantee of the due and punctual payment or delivery of all monetary obligations of ngfp owing to kaleyra promptly upon written demand by kaleyra. the foregoing description is only a summary of the confirmation and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the confirmation, which is filed as exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. the confirmation is included as an exhibit to this current report on form 8-k in order to provide investors and security holders with material information regarding its terms and the

an additional aggregate of $204,302.18, of which $102,151.09 was deposited into the trust account for the third monthly contribution, and the remaining $102,151.09 will be deposited into the trust

forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 regarding the business combination, company and kaleyra. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this current report on form 8-k and the attached exhibits that address activities, events or developments that the company and/or kaleyra expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements and are identified with, but not limited to, words such as believe and expect. such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the closing of the combination and the expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions, plans, prospects or strategies regarding the business combination and future business plans of the company and kaleyra management teams. in addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. these statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the management of the company and/or kaleyra in light of their respective experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments and their potential effects on the company and kaleyra as well as other factors they believe are appropriate in the circumstances. there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company or kaleyra will be those anticipated and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in this current report on form 8-k and in the attached exhibits due to many factors such as, but not limited to, the ability to satisfy closing conditions for the business combination, including that the company stockholders will approve the business combination, the ability of the combined company to meet the nyses listing standards, and that the company will have sufficient capital upon the approval of the business combination to operate as anticipated. should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the assumptions being made prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. these statements speak only as of the date they are made and none of

(the company) previously announced that it will hold a special meeting of stockholders on june 5, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the office of the company, located at 2479 e. bayshore rd., suite 200, palo alto, ca 94303 (the special meeting) to vote on a proposal to amend (the charter amendment) the companys second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the charter) to extend the date (the extension) by which the company must consummate its previously announced business combination (the business combination) with kaleyra s.p.a (kaleyra) for an additional six months, from june 12, 2019 to december 12, 2019 (the extended date). on may 16, 2019, the company announced that if the charter amendment is approved at the special meeting, the companys sponsor, gigacquistions, llc (the sponsor), and the other founders of gigcapital (together with the sponsor, the founders) have agreed to contribute to the company as a loan $240,000 for each calendar month, or portion thereof, that is needed by gigcapital to complete the business combination with kaleyra (each, a contribution). the contributions are conditional upon the implementation of the extension. the contributions will not occur if the charter amendment is not approved or the extension is not completed for any reason. the contributions will be deposited into the trust account established in connection with gigcapitals initial public offering (the trust account). as a result, the amount in the trust account following a contribution for redemption of shares of gigcapitals common stock issued in its initial public offering (each, a public share) that are not redeemed in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the extension, will be increased. the amount of the contributions will not bear interest and will be repayable by gigcapital upon consummation of the business combination with kaleyra. if the extension is implemented, the founders will make the first contribution on or before june 12, 2019. gigcapital will announce by the end of each calendar month whether there will be a subsequent contribution made, and any subsequent contributions will be made on or before the tenth of any such subsequent month. the sponsor will have the sole discretion to determine whether to continue extending for additional months until the extended date, and if the sponsor determines not to continue extending for additional months, the obligation of the sponsor and founders to make additional contributions will terminate and gigcapital will dissolve and liquidate in accordance with its charter. attached as exhibit 99.1 to this current report on form 8-k is the press release dated may 16, 2019 announcing the foregoing (the press release). kaleyra unaudited financial information as previously stated by the company in its definitive proxy statement for the special meeting as filed with the securities and exchange commission (the sec) on april 29, 2019, the sole purpose of the charter amendment is to allow kaleyra sufficient time to prepare the required financial statements needed before gigcapital can seek stockholder approval of the business combination with kaleyra. kalerya has been diligently working to prepare those financial statements, and gigcapital anticipates being able to move forward with the consummation of the business combination on the timeline previously announced when the parties announced the business combination. kaleyra has provided gigcapital with its unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for 2017, 2018 and the first fiscal quarter of 2019 based on u.s. gaap, as approved by the kaleyra board of directors (the financial information). that financial information is attached as exhibit 99.2 to this current report on form 8-k and was also included in the press release. non-gaap financial measure and related information the financial information includes reference to adjusted ebitda, a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). adjusted ebitda is defined as of any date of

the audited consolidated financial statements of such party and its subsidiaries (prepared in accordance with local gaap), plus (i) transaction expenses of kaleyra and gigcapital, (ii) without duplication of clause (i), severance or change of control payments, (iii) any expenses related to company restructuring, (iv) any compensation expenses relating to stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock or similar equity interests as may be issued by the post-combination company or any of its subsidiaries to their employees and (v) any provision for the write down of assets. the pro forma earnings of kaleyra, which is an italian company, and its subsidiaries, which include subsidiaries outside of the u.s., may not be prepared in conformance with article 11 of regulation s-x of the sec. adjusted ebitda is being used to determine whether conditions have been achieved that would result in the issuance of the earn-out and the vesting of the deferred shares. gigcapital management believes that this non-gaap measure of kaleyras financial results will provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to kaleyras anticipated financial condition and results of operations. investors should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate kaleyras anticipated business. additional information about

currency), divided by (y) 10. convertible notes interest on the notes will accrue at a fixed interest rate equal to the one-year u.s. dollar libor interest rate published in the wall street journal on

(50%) of the outstanding principal balance of the notes will be due and payable on the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the closing date. the remaining outstanding principal balance of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest and fees due under the notes will be due and payable in full on the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the closing date. in the event that the buyer receives, at any

common stock, in part or in whole, at the option of the holder of the notes by providing written notice at least three (3) business days prior to the date of conversion. a conversion of any portion of the note into shares of buyer common stock will be effected at a conversion price equal to the current market price as of the date of such conversion (the conversion price). the term current market price means, generally, the average vwap for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the date that is five (5) trading days prior to the date of conversion. the term vwap means, for any trading day, the volume weighted average trading price of the buyer common stock for such trading day on the nyse (or if the buyer common stock is no longer traded on the nyse, on such other exchange

1,563,631 1,363,639 notwithstanding the above, to the extent that the requisite level of adjusted ebitda for a fiscal year for the issuance of earnout shares is achieved but the requisite level of revenue is not so achieved, as long as the revenue for such fiscal year is at least eighty percent (80%) of the requisite level of revenue for the issuance of earnout shares, then the aggregate 2019 earnout shares or 2020 earnout shares, as applicable, will be deemed earned and issuable, but in an amount reduced by 0.5% for every 1.0% revenue for such fiscal year is below the revenue target for such fiscal year (the earnout reduction). for the purposes of determining whether earnout shares will be issued, adjusted ebitda is defined as of any date of calculation, as the consolidated earnings of a party and its subsidiaries, before finance income and finance cost (including bank charges), tax, depreciation and amortization calculated from the audited consolidated financial statements of such party and its subsidiaries (prepared in accordance with gaap), plus (i) expenses (as defined below), (ii) without duplication of clause (i), severance or change of control payments, (iii) any expenses related to company restructuring, (iv) any compensation expenses relating to stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock or similar equity interests as may be issued by the buyer or any of its subsidiaries to employees of the buyer or any of its subsidiaries and (v) any provision for the write down of assets. a partys adjusted ebitda for any fiscal year party is calculated on a pro forma basis to include any subsidiaries acquired by such party during such fiscal year. whether earnout shares are to be issued will be determined as soon as practicable (but in any event within fifteen (15) days) after the completion of the audited consolidated financial statements of the buyer as filed with the sec. to the extent that the seller representative disagrees with a determination whether earnout shares are to be issued, the purchase agreement provides for a customary process by which the seller representative and the buyer shall resolve any such disagreement before an independent nationally recognized accounting firm. if during the period when earnout shares can be earned (the earnout period), there is a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or bankruptcy of the buyer, or change of control of the buyer where the value of the aggregate consideration received by each holder of buyer common stock with respect to each share of buyer common stock held by such holder equals at least $10.00 per share of buyer common stock (subject to appropriate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and other recapitalizations) (each an acceleration event), then any earnout shares that have not been issued by the buyer (whether or not previously earned and whether or not any revenue or adjusted ebitda targets or thresholds have been achieved) shall be deemed earned and due by the buyer to the company stockholders. any dividends or distributions declared with respect to buyer common stock during the earnout period shall be set aside and not paid until the 2019 earnout shares and 2020 earnout shares have been issued to the company stockholders or, if either or both the 2019 earnout shares and the 2020 earnout shares are not earned and issued, then all such dividends or distributions declared during the earnout period shall be forfeited. certain holders of shares of buyer common stock have agreed that a portion of their shares of buyer common stock will be forfeited in the event that either the 2019 earnout shares or the 2020 earnout shares are not issued in full, as further described below under the heading founder shares agreement. lock-up subject to certain exceptions (including the sale of buyer common stock to satisfy certain taxes that may be payable by certain company stockholders upon the receipt of buyer common stock), each seller agrees that such seller shall not transfer any buyer common stock issued to such seller as part of the closing share consideration or any earnout shares that may have been issued to such seller until the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the closing date or (ii) the date, following the closing date, on which (x) the last sale price of buyer common stock equals or exceeds us$12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period commencing at least one hundred fifty (150) days after the closing date or (y) the buyers completion of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the buyers stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of buyer common stock for cash, securities or other property (such earliest date being the lock-up termination date). restricted stock units the buyer has agreed to adopt an equity incentive plan that it will submit to its stockholders for approval. so long as such equity incentive plan is adopted and approved, the buyer has agreed to issue to certain employees of the company or its subsidiaries 1,018,181 restricted stock units that would vest at the lock-up termination date, 136,367 restricted stock units that would vest upon the final determination, if any, that the 2019 earnout shares are earned and issuable, and 136,361 restricted stock units that would vest upon the final determination, if any, that the 2020 earnout shares are earned and issuable. representations and warranties the purchase agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the buyer and company with
