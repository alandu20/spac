company and parent, including the following: the company operates in a competitive industry; the level of demand for and market utilization of its solutions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty; the company has a history of losses, and anticipates that it will continue to incur losses in the future; the company may never achieve or sustain profitability; the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the covid-19 pandemic or other similar epidemics or adverse public health developments, including government responses to such events; developments affecting spending by the healthcare industry could adversely affect the company’s business; the company’s success depends on existing customers’ continuing or renewing their contracts; the company’s telemedicine business and growth strategy depends on its ability to maintain and expand a network of qualified physicians and other provider specialists; the company’s telemedicine business is dependent on its relationships with affiliated professional entities, which it does not own, to provide physician services, and its business would be adversely affected if those relationships were disrupted; the company depends upon third-party providers for certain technologies and equipment, and the loss of any of these providers, or their inability to meet the company’s needs could adversely affect its business; the company’s business could be harmed if it is unable to develop and release new solutions, or successful enhancements, new features and modifications to its existing solutions or if its solutions fail to operate as expected, including as a result of internet service interruptions; the company may become subject to claims for medical liability, misuse and disclosure of personally identifiable information and data breaches; and government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and the company’s business strategies. the company and parent urge you to carefully consider these and other risks, including as set forth below under “forward-looking statements”, that are inherent in an investment in parent in connection with the business combination or the company. if we cannot address any of the these risks and uncertainties effectively, or any other risks and difficulties
