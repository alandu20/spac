shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. item 7.01 regulation fd disclosure. on may 1, 2020 the company filed a prospectus supplement in connection with the offering, which included the following information, including a new risk factor: preliminary results based on preliminary financial results for the first quarter of 2020, the company expects to report:  revenue of approximately $44 million;  net loss of between $2 million and $3 million, which includes approximately $2 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $3 million of interest expense and $1 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses;  adjusted ebitda between $3 million and $4 million; and  approximately $39 million of cash on hand, as of march 31, 2020. the financial results for the first quarter ended march 31, 2020 are preliminary, estimated and unaudited, and are based on information available to management as of the date of this supplement and are subject to completion by management of the companys financial statements as of and for the quarter ended march 31, 2020. such financial data is based upon a number of assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control or relate to future business decisions, some of which may change. the company has provided ranges for certain of its estimated financial results described above primarily because the financial closing procedures for the quarter ended march 31, 2020 are not yet complete as of the date of this supplement. while certain of the above information is presented as a range of results, the actual results could fall outside of the suggested range. in addition, there is a possibility that the companys first quarter financial results could vary materially from these preliminary estimates due to, among other things, further information learned during that completion and finalization may alter the final results. in addition to the completion of the financial closing procedures, factors that could cause actual results to differ from those described above are set forth under risk factors herein and in the accompanying base prospectus. accordingly, you should not place undue reliance upon this preliminary information. furthermore, the preliminary estimates should not be viewed as a substitute for quarterly financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap). complete quarterly results will be included in our quarterly report on form 10-q for the three months ended march 31, 2020. business update in the first three months of 2020, the company implemented several strategic initiatives with a focus on improving revenue per order, cost per order, cash flow and profitability. for instance, one of the major initiatives was switching to an independent contractor driver model, which is close to completion. the company expects these actions to enable it to stabilize and position itself for long-term growth and in february 2020, the company realized its first ever profitable month. as the covid-19 pandemic became more widespread in the u.s., the company experienced a decrease in orders in mid-march, but orders began to rebound towards the end of march and continued to grow in april 2020. as of the date of this prospectus supplement, driver supply was at an all-time high and new restaurants have continued to sign up for our services. in response to the concerns posed by covid-19, the company has begun to offer no-contact delivery on all restaurant orders and has started to offer no-contact grocery delivery in certain markets. in addition, the company is working with its restaurant partners to waive delivery fees and is deploying free marketing programs for restaurants. the company has also begun to provide gloves, hand sanitizer and masks to its drivers. lastly, the company has committed to paying any employee who gets quarantined or contracts covid-19 while on the job. the company has thus far been able to operate effectively as it relates to the covid-19 pandemic. however, the potential impact and duration of the covid-19 pandemic on the global economy and on the companys business in particular may be difficult to assess or predict. the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce the companys ability to access capital and continue to operate effectively. the covid-19 pandemic could also reduce the demand for the companys services. in addition, a recession or further financial market correction resulting from the spread of covid-19 could adversely affect demand for the companys services. to the extent that the covid-19 pandemic adversely impacts the companys business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in the companys annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019. non-gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with gaap. we define adjusted ebitda as net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition and restructuring costs, stock-based compensation expense, impairments of intangible assets and goodwill and gains and losses associated with derivatives and debt extinguishments and when applicable, other expenses that do not reflect our core operations. we use this non-gaap financial measure as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences primarily caused by variations in capital structures, tax positions, the impact of acquisitions and restructuring, the impact of depreciation and amortization expense on our fixed assets and the impact of stock-based compensation expense. adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with gaap. see below for a reconciliation of preliminary, estimated net loss to adjusted ebitda for the first quarter ended march 31, 2020. three monthsendedmarch 31, 2020 ($ in millions) net loss $ (2) to (3 ) interest expense 3 depreciation and amortization 2 stock-based compensation 1 adjusted ebitda $ 3 to 4 we face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our operations. in december 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, covid-19, began in wuhan, hubei province, china. in march 2020, the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. waitr has thus far been able to operate effectively as it relates to the covid-19 pandemic. however, the potential impacts and duration of the covid-19 pandemic on the global economy and on the companys business, in particular, are uncertain and may be difficult to assess or predict. the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce the companys ability to access capital and continue to operate effectively. the covid-19 pandemic could also reduce the demand for the companys services. in addition, a recession or further financial market correction resulting from the spread of covid-19 could adversely affect demand for the companys services. to the extent that the covid-19 pandemic adversely impacts the companys business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, it may also have the effect of increasing many of the other risks described in the risk factors in the companys 2019 form 10-k. we have taken several steps to help protect and support our restaurant partners, diners, drivers and employees during the covid-19 outbreak, including offering no-contact delivery for all restaurant delivery orders; offering no-contact grocery delivery in select markets; working with restaurant partners to waive diner delivery fees; deploying free marketing programs for restaurants; and providing masks and gloves to drivers. we are closely monitoring the impact of the covid-19 global outbreak and lifting of any restrictions, although there remains significant uncertainty related to the public health situation globally. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

an indefinite term that will continue until terminated in accordance with its terms. the price agreement provides for an annual salary equal to $400,000, and a target annual cash bonus equal to $400,000, based upon the attainment of certain performance metrics determined by the company’s board of directors. mr. price will be able to participate in the same incentive compensation and benefit plans in which other senior executives of the company are eligible to participate. pursuant to the price agreement, on or as soon as practicable following the effective date, mr. price shall receive an award of restricted stock units subject to the terms of the waitr holdings inc. 2018 omnibus incentive plan (the “incentive plan”), having a grant date fair market value (as defined in the

reason (as defined in the price agreement), mr. price will be entitled to receive (i) all accrued salary through the date of termination, (ii) reimbursement of expenses properly incurred in the course

an amount equal to one times (1x) his base salary, which shall be paid in periodic installments over the twelve (12) month period following the date of termination, less applicable deductions and

under the price agreement exceed the amount allowed under section 280g of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the “code”), for him (thereby subjecting mr. price to an excise tax), then such payments due to mr. price will either (i) be reduced (but not below zero) so that the aggregate present value of the payments and benefits received by mr. price is $1.00 less than the amount which would otherwise cause mr. price to incur an excise tax under section 4999 of the code or (ii) be paid in full, whichever results in the greatest net after-tax payment to him. 1 the foregoing
