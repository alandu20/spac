Item 5.03 Amendments to Memorandum of Association and Articles
of Association.

 

On April 23, 2019, in connection with the
Special Meeting (defined as below), Alberton Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) filed with the
Registrar of the British Virgin Islands an Amendment to Regulation 47 of the Company’s Articles of Association, a copy of
which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

 

Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

 

On April 23, 2020, the Company held its
special meeting of the shareholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the Company’s
shareholders voted on two proposals, each of which is described in more details in the Company’s definitive proxy statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2020 (the “Proxy Statement”). At the beginning
of the Special Meeting, there were 10,065,492 ordinary shares in person or by proxy, which represented 68.52% of the voting power
of the ordinary shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, which constituted a quorum for the transaction of business. As
a result, the proposal to adjourn the meeting was no longer applicable.

 

At the Special Meeting, the following proposal
were voted on and approved:

 

To amend the Company’s memorandum and
articles of association (as may amended from time to time, the “M&A”), to extend the date before
which the Company must complete a business combination (the “Termination Date”) from April 27, 2020
(the “Current Termination Date”) to October 26, 2020 or such earlier date as determined by the Board
of the Company (the “Extended Termination Date”), and provide that the date for cessation of operations
of the Company if the Company has not completed a business combination would similarly be extended by amending the M&A to
include an additional regulation 47.15 in the Articles of Association.

exercised their right to redeem such public shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account. As a result, an aggregate of $105,879,118
(or $10.51 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay such holders.
