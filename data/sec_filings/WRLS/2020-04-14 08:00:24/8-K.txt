Introductory
Note

 

On
April 7, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc. (f/k/a/ Pensare Acquisition Corp.),
a Delaware corporation (“AVCT”), consummated the previously announced business combination pursuant to that certain
Business Combination Agreement, dated July 24, 2019, as amended (the “Agreement”), by and among AVCT, Tango Merger
Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), Stratos Management Systems Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (“Holdings”), and Stratos Management Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Computex”), pursuant
to which Computex merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of AVCT (the “Surviving Corporation”). Capitalized terms used in this Current Report on Form 8-K
but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Agreement.

 

Following
the completion of the Merger (the “Closing”), substantially all of AVCT’s assets and operations are held and
conducted by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and AVCT’s only assets are all of the issued and outstanding
equity interests in the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Closing, but in connection therewith, the registrant changed its name
from “Pensare Acquisition Corp.” to “American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc.” Unless the context otherwise
requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refer to the combined company and
its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries.

 

The
foregoing description of the Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, Amendment
No. 1 to the Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2019 (“Amendment No. 1”), by and among AVCT, Merger Sub, Holdings,
and Computex, and Amendment No. 2 to the Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2020 (“Amendment No. 2”), by and among AVCT,
Merger Sub, Holdings, and Computex, copies of which are filed as Exhibit 2.1, Exhibit 2.2 and Exhibit 2.3, respectively, to this
Current Report on Form 8-K. A more detailed description of the Merger and related transactions can be found in AVCT’s definitive
proxy statement (filed while AVCT was still called “Pensare Acquisition Corp.”) in connection with the solicitation
of proxies from AVCT’s stockholders to approve the Merger and related transactions filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) on February 13, 2020 (the “Proxy Statement”).

 

Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

 

Third
Amendment to Loan Documents

 

Concurrently
with the Closing, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation and Comerica Bank (“Comerica”)
entered into a Third Amendment to Loan Documents (the “Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment added the Company and
the Surviving Corporation as borrowers under the existing Credit Agreement, dated December 18, 2017 (as amended, the “Credit
Agreement”), to which Computex and Comerica are parties, and amended certain provisions of the Credit Agreement, including
changing the maturity date of the loans under the Credit Agreement to December 31, 2020, and removing certain financial covenants
under the Credit Agreement.

 

The
foregoing description of the Third Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and
conditions of the Third Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein
by reference.

 

Registration
Rights Agreement

 

Concurrently
with the Closing, the Company, Pensare Sponsor Group, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and certain other initial stockholders of
the Company, as well as Holdings and the other Investors (as defined below), entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the
“Registration Rights Agreement”). The Registration Rights Agreement amended, restated and replaced the registration
rights agreement entered into among AVCT, the Sponsor and certain other initial stockholders of AVCT on July 27, 2017. Pursuant
to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the holders of certain of the Company’s securities, including the Company’s
founder shares, the shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) underlying the Company’s
private warrants, and the shares of Common Stock underlying the securities issued in the Private Placement (as defined below)
are entitled to certain registration rights under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws with respect to such
shares of Common Stock, including up to eight demand registrations in the aggregate and customary “piggy-back” registration
rights.

 

The
foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K
and is incorporated herein by reference.

Convertible
Debentures, Warrants and Guaranty

 

Concurrently
with the Closing, the Company consummated the sale, in a private placement (the “Private Placement”), of units of
securities of the Company (“Units”) to certain investors (each, an “Investor”), as contemplated by the
terms of the previously disclosed Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2020 (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”).
Each Unit consists of (i) $1,000 in principal amount of the Company’s Series A convertible debentures (the “Debentures”)
and (ii) a warrant to purchase 100 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per whole share (the “Warrants”).
The issuances of such securities were not registered under the Securities Act in reliance on the exemption from registration provided
by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

 

Debentures

 



At the Closing, the Company
issued to Investors Debentures having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $43.4 million (including $3.0 million in aggregate
principal amount issued as part of Units sold to MasTec, Inc., a greater than 5% stockholder of the Company (“MasTec”),
of which $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount was part of Units issued to Holdings pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
and approximately $8.8 million in aggregate principal amount was issued to the Sponsor as part of Units issued in exchange for
the cancellation of indebtedness previously incurred by the Company to the Sponsor). The Debentures bear interest at a rate of
10% per annum, payable quarterly on the last day of each calendar quarter in the form of additional Debentures, except upon maturity
in which case accrued and unpaid interest is payable in cash. The entire principal amount of each Debenture, together with accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, is due and payable on the earlier of (i) such date, commencing on or after October 7, 2022, as the
holder thereof, at its sole option, upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice to the Company, demands payment thereof
and (ii) the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Debentures).





 

Each
Debenture is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time at the option of the holder thereof into that number of shares of Common
Stock calculated by dividing the principal amount being converted, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, by the
applicable conversion price, initially $3.45. The conversion price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock
splits, reclassifications and the like, and is also subject to price-based adjustment, on a “full ratchet” basis,
in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock at a price
below the then-applicable conversion price (subject to certain exceptions). The Debentures are subject to mandatory conversion
if the closing price of the Common Stock exceeds $6.00 for any 40 trading days within a consecutive 60 trading day-period, subject
to the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The Debentures are subordinated to all Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the
Debentures), including indebtedness under the Credit Agreement.

 

Warrants

 

At
the Closing, the Company issued to Investors Warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 4,343,432 shares of Common Stock (including
Warrants to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares, 883,057 shares, and 300,000 shares issued to Holdings, the Sponsor and MasTec, respectively,
as part of the Units issued to them), at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The Warrants are exercisable at any time through
the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. The number of shares issuable upon exercise of each Warrant is subject to customary
adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like.

 

Guaranty

 

At
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries issued to the Investors a Guaranty, pursuant to which such entities
jointly and severally guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Debentures.

 

The
foregoing descriptions of the Debentures, the Warrants and the Guaranty do not purport to be complete and are qualified in its
entireties by the terms and conditions of the form of Debentures, form of Warrants and the Guaranty, which are filed as Exhibit
10.4, Exhibit 10.5 and Exhibit 10.6, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

●each
                                         person who is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Common
                                         Stock;

judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. AVCT’s board of directors has determined that Messrs. U. Bertram
Ellis, Jr., Karl Krapek, Dennis Lockhart, Dr. Klaas Baks and Ms. Suzanne Shank are “independent directors” as defined
