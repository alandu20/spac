Introductory
Note

 

On April 13, 2020, American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc. (f/k/a Pensare Acquisition Corp.), a Delaware corporation (“AVCT”),
filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the “Original Report”) to report the closing of the Merger and related matters
under Items 1.01, 2.01, 2.03, 3.02, 3.03, 5.01, 5.02 and 9.01 of Form 8-K. Due to the large number of events to be reported
under the specified items of Form 8-K, this Form 8-K/A is being filed to amend the Original Report to include additional matters
related to the closing of Merger under Items 3.01 and 5.06 of Form 8-K.

 

Capitalized terms used
herein by not defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Original Report.  



  

Item
3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing

 

On
April 9, 2020, the Company received a letter (the “Determination Letter”) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it
had not complied with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2, which requires that the Company meet the requirements
for initial listing after completion of the Business Combination. The Determination Letter states that the Company’s common
stock does not meet the minimum $4.00 bid price and the $15 million market value of publicly held shares requirements, which are
set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5505. The Company has requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, which request has stayed
any further action by Nasdaq pending the conclusion of the hearing process. The Company will address the Determination Letter
at its hearing. The Determination Letter does not impact the Company’s obligation to file periodic reports and other reports
with the SEC under applicable federal securities laws. There can be no assurance that the Company’s appeal will be successful.

  

Item
5.06. Change in Shell Company Status.

 

As
a result of the consummation of the Merger, which fulfilled the definition of an initial business combination as required by the
Charter, AVCT ceased to be a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, as of the Closing Date. The material
terms of the Merger are described in the Proxy Statement in the section entitled “The Business Combination” beginning
on page 65, which is incorporated herein by reference.
