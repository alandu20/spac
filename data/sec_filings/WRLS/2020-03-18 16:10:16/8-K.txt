Item 3.01.Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 

As
previously disclosed, on September 11, 2019, Pensare Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) received a written notice from
the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company was not in
compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(3), which requires the Company to have at least 300 public holders for continued listing by
Nasdaq. Additionally, on September 23, 2019, the Company received a written notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Company was
not in compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(4), due to the Company’s failure to meet the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares
requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq. The Company submitted to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance pursuant to IM-5101-2
and received an extension until March 9, 2020 to regain compliance with Listing Rules 5550(a)(3) and 5550(a)(4).

 

On
March 10, 2020, the Company received a letter (the “Determination Letter”) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it
did not satisfy the terms of the extension as the Company did not complete a business combination within the timeframe specified
and that Nasdaq has initiated procedures to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq. The Company was also notified that
as a result of Nasdaq's determination to delist the Company's common stock, the Company's rights and warrants no longer comply
with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5560(a), which requires the underlying securities of rights and warrants to remain listed on Nasdaq, and
the Company's units no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(b)(1)(A), which requires all component parts of units to meet
the requirements for initial and continued listing, and the Company's units, rights and warrants are now subject to delisting.


 

The
Company has requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, which request automatically stayed any further action by Nasdaq
pending the conclusion of the hearing process. The Determination Letter does not impact the Company’s obligation to
file periodic reports and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under applicable federal
securities laws. There can be no assurance that the Company’s appeal will be successful.
