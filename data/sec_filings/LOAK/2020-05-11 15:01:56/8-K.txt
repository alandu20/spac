Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On May 8, 2020, Live Acquisition Corp. (the
“Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”).
Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”),
and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit,
generating gross proceeds to the Company of $200,000,000. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45 day option to purchase
up to an additional 3,000,000 Units at the initial public offering price to cover over allotments, if any.

 

In connection with the IPO, the Company
entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s Registration Statement
on Form S-1 (File No. 333-236800) related to the IPO, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”)
on March 2, 2020 (as amended, the “Registration Statement”):

 



     
    ●
    An Underwriting Agreement, dated May 5, 2020, by and between the Company and Jefferies LLC, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    A Warrant Agreement, dated May 5, 2020, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    A Letter Agreement, dated May 5, 2020, by and among the Company, its officers, its directors and the Company’s sponsor, Live Oak Sponsor Partners LLC (the “Sponsor”), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated May 5, 2020, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    A Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 5, 2020, by and between the Company, the Sponsor and certain other stockholders of the Company, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

  



     
    ●
    Private Placement Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated May 5, 2020 (the “Warrant Subscription Agreement”), by and between the Company and the Sponsor, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.4 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

  

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO,
pursuant to the Warrant Subscription Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 6,000,000 Warrants (the
“Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $6,000,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units
sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement. No underwriting discounts or
commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption
from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On May 5, 2020, in connection with the IPO,
the Company filed its Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
effective the same day. The terms of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are set forth in the Registration
Statement and are incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is attached
as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 

Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

A total of $200,000,000, comprised of $196,150,000
of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $6,737,500 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and $3,850,000 of
the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 interest to pay dissolution
expenses), the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion
of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Company’s public shares properly submitted
in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) to modify
the substance or timing of its obligation to offer redemption rights in connection with any proposed initial business combination
or to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of the IPO or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business
combination activity and (iii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.

 

On May 5, 2020, the Company issued a press
