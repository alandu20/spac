Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

On
May 8, 2020, Live Oak Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company,
par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one half of one redeemable warrant of the Company
(each whole warrant, a “Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share
of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $200,000,000.  The Company has granted the underwriters a 45 day option to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000
Units at the initial public offering price to cover over allotments, if any.

 

On
May 8, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 6,000,000
Warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Live Oak Sponsor Partners LLC (the “Sponsor”),
generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,000,000. Each of the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable to purchase one
share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share.

 

 A
total of $200,000,000 representing the net proceeds from the sale of the Units and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in
a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting
as trustee.

 

 An
audited balance sheet as of May 8, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement
has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
