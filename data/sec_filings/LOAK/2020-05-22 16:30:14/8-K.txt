Separate Trading of Units, Class A
Common Stock and Warrants

 

On
May 22, 2020, Live Oak Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) announced that, commencing on May 28, 2020, the holders
of units issued in its initial public offering (the “Units”), each consisting of one share of Class A common
stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one half of one warrant
of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class
A Common Stock for $11.50 per share, may elect to separately trade shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants included in the
Units. No fractional Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants will trade. The Units not separated
will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “LOAK.U”. Shares of Class A Common Stock and
the Warrants are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “LOAK” and “LOAK WS,”
respectively. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the
Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants.
