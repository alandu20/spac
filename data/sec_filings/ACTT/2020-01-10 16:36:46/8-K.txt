On January 10, 2020, Act II Global
Acquisition Corp. (“Act II”) issued a press release announcing that it will present and meet with investors at the
22nd Annual ICR Conference, held at the Grand Lakes Resort in Orlando, Florida. Act II is scheduled to present on Monday,
January 13, 2020 at 4:30 p.m. ET. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

 

 

Additional Information and Where
to Find It

 

In connection with the proposed business
combination, Act II intends to file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 and will mail the definitive proxy statement/prospectus
and other relevant documentation to Act II shareholders. This filing does not contain all the information that should be considered
concerning the proposed transaction. It is not intended to form the basis of any investment decision or any other decision with
respect to the business combination. This communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to
buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would
be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities
shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the federal securities laws.

 

Act II shareholders and other interested
persons are advised to read, when available, the preliminary proxy statement and any amendments thereto, and the definitive proxy
statement in connection with Act II’s solicitation of proxies for the special meeting to be held to approve the proposed
transaction, because these materials will contain important information about Merisant Company (“Merisant”), MAFCO
Worldwide LLC (“Mafco”) and Act II and the proposed transaction. 

 

The definitive proxy statement will
be mailed to Act II shareholders as of a record date to be established for voting on the business combination when it becomes available.
Shareholders will also be able to obtain a copy of the preliminary proxy statement and definitive proxy statement once they are
available, without charge, at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to Act II at 745 5th Avenue, New
York, NY 10151.

 

Participants in the Solicitation

 

Act II, Merisant, Mafco and their respective directors and officers
and representatives or affiliates may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of Act II shareholders in connection
with the business combination. Act II shareholders and other interested persons may obtain, without charge, more detailed information
regarding the directors and officers of Act II in the final prospectus of Act II, which was filed with the SEC on April 29, 2019.
Information regarding the persons who may, under SEC rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to Act II
shareholders in connection with the business combination will be set forth in the proxy statement for the business combination
when available. Additional information regarding the interests of participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with
the business combination will be included in the proxy statement that Act II intends to file with the SEC and other documents furnished
or filed with the SEC by Act II.
