Introductory
Note

 

On June 30, 2020, Whole
Earth Brands, Inc. (the “Company” or “Whole Earth Brands”) filed a Current Report on Form
8-K (the “Original Report”) to report the closing of the Business Combination and related matters under Items
1.01, 2.01, 3.02, 3.03, 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 5.07, and 9.01 of Form 8-K. Due to the large number of events to be reported under the
specified items of Form 8-K, this Form 8-K/A is being filed to amend the Original Report to include additional matters related
to the closing of the Business Combination under Items 2.03, 4.01, 5.05, 5.06, 7.01,  8.01 and 9.01.

 

Capitalized terms used
herein but not defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Original Report.

 

 


Item 2.03Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation
Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a 	Registrant




 

Reference is made
to the disclosure set forth under Item 1.01 of the Original Report on Form 8-K concerning the Credit Agreement,
which is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.


 


Item 4.01.Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant. 

 

On June 30, 2020,
the board of directors of the Company approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) as the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company’s consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2020. EY served as independent registered public accounting firm of Merisant and MAFCO prior
to the Business Combination. Accordingly, Marcum LLP (“Marcum”), Act II’s independent registered
public accounting firm prior to the Business Combination, was informed that it would be dismissed as the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.

 

The report of
Marcum on Act II’s, the Company’s legal predecessor, consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and the
related statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019,
did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainties, audit
scope or accounting principles.

 

For the year ended
December 31, 2019, there were no disagreements between the Company and Marcum on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Marcum would have
caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its report on the Company’s financial statements
for such period.

 

For the year ended
December 31, 2019, there were no “reportable events” (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act).

 

The Company has provided
Marcum with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and has requested that Marcum furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the
SEC stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the Company set forth above.

 

A copy of Marcum’s letter
dated June 30, 2020, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Original Report on Form 8-K.


 


Item 5.05.Amendments to the Registrant’s Code of Ethics, or Waiver of a Provision of the Code of Ethics.

 

On June 24, 2020, in
connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the board of directors of the Company approved and adopted a Code of Ethics
(the “Code of Ethics”). The Code of Ethics applies to the Company’s employees, officers, and members of
the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Covered Individuals”). The Code of Ethics replaced the Code of Ethics
of Act II (the “Act II Code of Ethics”), which was previously adopted by Act II in connection with its initial
public offering in April 2019.

 

The Code of Ethics
reflects (among other matters) amendments, clarifications, revisions and updates in relation to (i) the general principles
and standards of ethical conduct of the Covered Individuals designed to deter wrongdoing, (ii) the specific provisions for
the chief executive officer and senior financial officers of the Company, (iii) the internal procedures for reporting and
enforcing violations of the Code of Ethics, and (iv) requests for waivers and amendments of the Code of Ethics. The amendments,
clarifications, revisions and updates reflected in the Code of Ethics did not relate to or result in any waiver, explicit or implicit,
of any provision of the Act II Code of Ethics.

 

The foregoing description
of the updates to the Company’s Code of Ethics does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the Code of Ethics, attached  as Exhibit 14.1 to the Original Report and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.06.Change in Shell Company Status.




 

As a result of
the Business Combination, Act II ceased being a shell company. Reference is made to the disclosure in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in the section titled “Shareholder Proposal 1: The Business Combination Proposal,”
and in the Supplement in the section titled “Supplemental Information to Proposal No. 1 — Business Combination
Proposal,” each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The information contained in Item 2.01 of the
Original Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.06.


 


Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure




  

On June 25, 2020, the
Company issued a press release announcing the closing of the Business Combination. The press release is attached  as Exhibit
99.1 to the Original Report.

  

The information
in this Item 7.01 and Exhibit 99.1 attached to the Original Report shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of
Section 18 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the
liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.



 


Item 8.01.Other Events




  

As a result of the
Business Combination and by operation of Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company is a successor issuer to
Act II. The Company hereby reports this succession in accordance with Rule 12g-3(f) under the Exchange Act.
