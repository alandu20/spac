Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

The information included in Item 8.01 is incorporated
into this Item by reference.

 

Item 8.01. Other Events

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K dated August 7, 2019, Orisun Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of 4,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Common
Stock”), one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a
price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of
an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $40,000,000.
The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 600,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

As also previously disclosed in the Current
Report, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”)
of 220,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,200,000.

 

Subsequently, on August 26, 2019,
the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units
occurred on August 28, 2019. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 440,024 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted
in total gross proceeds of $4,400,240. On August 28, 2019, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, the Company
consummated the private sale of an additional 13,201 Private Units, generating gross proceeds of $132,010. On August 29, 2019,
the underwriters canceled the remainder of the over-allotment option. In connection with the cancellation of the remainder of
the over-allotment option, the Company will cancel an aggregate of 39,990 shares of Common Stock issued to Everstone Investments
LLC, the Company’s sponsor, prior to the IPO and Private Placement.

 

A total of $44,400,240 of the net proceeds from the sale
of Units in the initial public offering (including the over-allotment option units) and the private placements on August 6, 2019
and August 28, 2019, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. Included
with this report as Exhibit 99.1 is a pro-forma balance sheet reflecting the exercise of the over-allotment option.

The Private Units are
identical to the Units sold in the IPO. However, the holders have agreed to certain restrictions on the Private Units, as described
in the Registration Statement. Additionally, the holders agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying
securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s
initial business combination. The holders were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the
Private Units.

The Private Units were
issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
