Item 8.01. Other Events

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K dated August 2, 2019, Orisun Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of 4,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists one share of common stock (“Common Stock”),
one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50
per whole share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business
combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $40,000,000. The underwriters
were granted a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 Units to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

As of August 6, 2019, a total of $40,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the private placement were deposited in a trust account established for
the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders.
