Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
August 2, 2019, the registration statement (File No. 333-232356) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial
public offering (“IPO”) of Orisun Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) was declared effective by the Securities
and Exchange Commission. In connection therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits
to the Registration Statement:

 


●An
Underwriting Agreement, dated August 2, 2019, by and between the Company and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”),
as representative of the underwriters;

 


●A
Warrant Agreement, dated August 2, 2019, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC;

 


●A
Rights Agreement, dated August 2, 2019, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC;


 


●Letter
Agreements, dated August 2, 2019, by and between the Company and each of the initial stockholders, officers and directors of the
Company;



 


●An
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated August 2, 2019, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC;

 


●A
Stock Escrow Agreement, dated August 2, 2019, by and among the Company, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC and each
of the initial stockholders of the Company; and

 


●A
Registration Rights Agreement, dated August 2, 2019, by and among the Company, the initial stockholders of the Company and Chardan.

 

On
August 6, 2019, the Company consummated the IPO of 4,000,000 units (the “Units). Each Unit consists of one share of common
stock (“Common Stock”), one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one share
of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon
the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds of $40,000,000. The underwriters were granted a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 Units to cover
over-allotments, if any.

 

In
addition, the Company sold to Chardan, for $100, an option to purchase up to 300,000 units exercisable at $11.50 per unit pursuant
to the Unit Purchase Option agreement as set forth in Exhibit 4.3, commencing on the later of the consummation of a business combination
and six months from the effective date of the Registration Statement.

 

As
of August 6, 2019, a total of $40,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited
in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. An audited balance sheet as of August
6, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement will be filed within 4 business
days of the consummation of the IPO.

 

Item
3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with its sponsor
and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, of 220,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating
total proceeds of $2,220,000.

 

The
Private Units are identical to the Units (as defined above) sold in the IPO except that the warrants included in the Private Units
will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial
purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally, the holders of the Private Units have agreed to certain restrictions
on the Private Units, as described in the Registration Statement. Additionally, such holders agreed not to transfer, assign or
sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement)
until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The holders were granted certain demand and piggyback
registration rights in connection with the Private Units.

The
Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transaction did not involve
a public offering.

 

Item
5.03. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On
August 2, 2019, in connection with the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the State
of Delaware, effective the same day. The terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is set forth in the Registration
Statement and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is attached
