IMPORTANT
NOTICES

 

Important
Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

This
Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements
about the pending transactions among Orisun Acquisition Corp. (“Orisun”), Ucommune International Ltd (“Purchaser”),
Everstone International Ltd (“Merger Sub”), and Ucommune Group Holdings Limited (“Ucommune”) and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and the parties’ perspectives and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Such statements include,
but are not limited to, statements regarding the proposed transaction, including the anticipated initial enterprise value and
post-closing equity value, the benefits of the proposed transaction, integration plans, expected synergies and revenue opportunities,
anticipated future financial and operating performance and results, including estimates for growth, the expected management and
governance of the combined company, and the expected timing of the transactions. The words “expect,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “intend,” “plan” and similar expressions indicate forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
assumptions (including assumptions about general economic, market, industry and operational factors), known or unknown, which
could cause the actual results to vary materially from those indicated or anticipated.

 

Such
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (i) risks related to the expected timing and likelihood of completion
of the pending transaction, including the risk that the transaction may not close due to one or more closing conditions to the
transaction not being satisfied or waived, such as regulatory approvals not being obtained, on a timely basis or otherwise, or
that a governmental entity prohibited, delayed or refused to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction or required
certain conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals; (ii) risks related to the ability of Orisun
and Ucommune to successfully integrate the businesses; (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could
give rise to the termination of the applicable transaction agreements; (iv) the risk that there may be a material adverse change
with respect to the financial position, performance, operations or prospects of Ucommune or Orisun; (v) risks related to disruption
of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (vi) the risk that any announcements relating
to the proposed transaction could have adverse effects on the market price of Orisun’s securities; (vii) the risk that the
proposed transaction and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of Ucommune and Orisun to retain customers
and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers and customers and on their operating results
and businesses generally; (viii) the risk that the combined company may be unable to achieve cost-cutting synergies or it may
take longer than expected to achieve those synergies; and (ix) risks associated with the financing of the proposed transaction.
A further list and description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Orisun’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC, in Orisun’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC subsequent
thereto and in the Registration Statement on Form F-4 and proxy statement that will be filed with the SEC by the Purchaser in
connection with the proposed transactions, and other documents that the parties may file or furnish with the SEC, which you are
encouraged to read. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate only to the date
they were made, and Orisun, Purchaser, Merger Sub, Ucommune, and their subsidiaries undertake no obligation to update forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made except as required by law or applicable regulation.

connection with the transaction described herein, Orisun and Purchaser will file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange

Shares if (x) the VWAP of the Purchaser Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $16.50 (or any foreign currency equivalent)
in any twenty trading days within a thirty trading day period before December 31, 2022 on any securities exchange or securities
market on which the Purchaser Ordinary Shares are then traded or (y) Ucommune’s revenue exceeds RMB850,000,000 in the fiscal
year of 2020 pursuant to the audited consolidated financial statements of Ucommune as of and for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2020; (2) 1,000,000 Purchaser Class A Ordinary Shares if (x) the VWAP of the Purchaser Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds
$22.75 (or any foreign currency equivalent) in any twenty trading days within a thirty trading day period before December 31,
2023 on any securities exchange or securities market on which the Purchaser Ordinary Shares are then traded or (y) Ucommune’s
revenue exceeds RMB1,275,000,000 in the fiscal year of 2021 pursuant to the audited consolidated financial statements of Ucommune
as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021; and (3) 1,000,000 Purchaser Class A Ordinary Shares if (x) the VWAP of
the Purchaser Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $30 (or any foreign currency equivalent) in any twenty trading days within

Shares are then traded or (y) Ucommune’s revenue exceeds RMB1,912,000,000 in the fiscal year of 2022 pursuant to the audited
consolidated financial statements of Ucommune as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
