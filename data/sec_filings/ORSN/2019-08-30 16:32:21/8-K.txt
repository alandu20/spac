    Item 3.01
    Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

On
August 28, 2019, Orisun Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) received a notice from the Staff of the Listing Qualifications
Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, based upon the Staff’s
determination, the common stock contained in the Company’s units is not in compliance with the minimum 300 round lot holders
required for the listing of its units on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in the initial listing requirements of Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5505(a)(3), or the minimum 300 public holders required for continued listing, as set forth in the continued listing
requirements of Rule 5550(a)(3). Therefore, the Company’s units will be delisted from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requests
a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”).

The
Company intends to appeal Nasdaq’s determination and comply with the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. However, there
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to satisfy the applicable listing requirements. Pending the decision to be rendered
by the Panel, the Company’s units will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the trading symbol “ORSNU.” Because
Nasdaq will be unable to list the Company’s common stock, rights or warrants if the units separate, the Company does not
expect to separate the Units until after it receives a decision from the Panel.
