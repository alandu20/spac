    Item 8.01
    Other Events

 

On June 3, 2019, Proficient Alpha Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 10,000,000 units (“Units”),
each Unit consisting of one share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), one warrant (“Warrant”)
to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, and one right (“Right”) to receive
one-tenth of one share of Common Stock upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, pursuant to the registration
statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-231084) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Units
were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000. Pursuant to an underwriting agreement,
dated May 29, 2019, between the Company and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. as representative
of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”), the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase
up to 1,500,000 additional Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-Allotment Option”); and simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option in full.

 

As previously reported on a Current Report
on Form 8-K of the Company, filed with the SEC on June 4, 2019, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed
a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 5,375,000 placement warrants, which were purchased
by Mr. Shih-Chung Chou (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $5,375,000. 

 

A total of $115,000,000 of the net proceeds
from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public
stockholders.  An audited balance sheet as of June 3, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the
IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
