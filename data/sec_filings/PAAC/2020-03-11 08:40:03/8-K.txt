that may be instituted against the Company, Lion or others following announcement of the Business Combination Agreement and the
transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement
due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of the Company; (4) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated
