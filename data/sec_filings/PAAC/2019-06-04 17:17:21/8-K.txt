Simultaneously with
the consummation of the initial public offering (“IPO”) and the sale of the Units (defined below), Proficient Alpha
Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”)
of 5,375,000 warrants (“Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of
$5,375,000. The Placement Warrants, which were purchased by Mr. Shih-Chung Chou (the “Sponsor”), are substantially
similar to the Public Warrants, except that if held by the Sponsor or his permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants (i) may
be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption and (iii) are, subject to
certain limited exceptions, subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of the Company’s initial
business combination.  If the Placement Warrants are held by holders other than Sponsor or his permitted transferees,
the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants (defined
below).

On June
3, 2019, the Company consummated its IPO of 10,000,000 units (“Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of
common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), one warrant (“Public Warrant”) to purchase
one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth of
one share of Common Stock upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination.  The Units were sold at
an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company
granted the underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units
solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-Allotment Option”); and simultaneously with the consummation of
the IPO, the Underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option in full.





 

A total of $115,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s
public stockholders at Morgan Stanley, N.A., with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC acting as trustee. Except for
the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes and interest to pay any dissolution expenses, none of the funds held in the trust account
will be released until the earlier of the completion of the Company’s initial business combination or the redemption of 100%
of the Common Stock issued by the Company in the IPO if the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination within
18 months from the closing of the IPO.  

 

Copies of the press
releases issued by the Company announcing the pricing of the IPO and the consummation of the IPO are included as Exhibits 99.1
and 99.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
