On April 22, 2020,

to this Current Report on Form 8-K, announcing that the holders of the Company’s units (the “Units”) may elect
to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and
warrants (the “Warrants”) included in the Units commencing on or about April 27, 2020. Each Unit consists of one share
of Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one redeemable Warrant to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock. Any Units not separated
will continue to trade on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “FEAC.U”, and the Class A Common Stock and Warrants
will separately trade on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “FEAC” and “FEAC WS”, respectively.  No
fractional Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need
to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate
the Units into shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants.
