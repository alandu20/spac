 Item 8.01. Other Events. 
On June 26, 2019, GigCapital2, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), announced that the holders of the Companys public
units (the Public Units), which were issued pursuant to the initial registration statement on Form S-1, as amended
(File No. 333-231337) and the subsequent registration statement on
Form S-1 (File No. 333-231979) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its initial public offering
(IPO) and declared effective on June 5, 2019, may elect to separately trade the shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (Common Stock), rights and warrants included in such Public Units
commencing on July 1, 2019.  Each Public Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock
(Public Warrant), and one right to receive one-twentieth ( 1/20)
of one share of Common Stock upon the Companys completion of an initial business combination. Each Public Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. 
Those Public Units not separated will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol GIX.U. The Common Stock, rights and warrants included in the
Public Units are expected to trade under the symbols GIX and GIX RT and GIX WS, respectively. Holders of Public Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, the Companys transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into shares of Common Stock, rights and warrants.  A copy of the press release
issued by the Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Public Units is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
