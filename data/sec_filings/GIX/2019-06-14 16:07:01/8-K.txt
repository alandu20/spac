 Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. 
As previously disclosed by GigCapital2, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), in its Current Report on Form 8-K (the IPO Closing 8-K) as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on June 10, 2019, simultaneously with the
closing of the initial public offering (the IPO) and the sale of the Public Units (as defined in Item 8.01 below), the Company consummated the private placement (Private Placement) of (i) an aggregate of
492,500 units (the Private Placement Units), at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, with each of GigAcquisitions2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Sponsor), EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (EarlyBird), Northland Gig 2 Investment LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Northland Investment, and together with Sponsor and Earlybird, the Founders), pursuant to
the respective Unit Purchase Agreements disclosed in the IPO Closing 8-K (the Unit Purchase Agreements), and (ii) 100,000 shares of Common Stock (the Private Underwriter
Shares) to Northland Securities, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (Northland) pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement disclosed in the IPO Closing 8-K (the Share Purchase
Agreement). Among the Founders, Sponsor purchased 417,500 Private Placement Units; EarlyBird purchased 26,000 Private Placement Units; and Northland Investment purchased 49,000 Private Placement Units. The Private Placement generated
aggregate gross proceeds of $5,925,000, consisting of $4,925,000 from the sale of the Private Placement Units and $1,000,000 from the sale of the Private Underwriter Shares. The Private Placement Units are substantially similar to the Public
Units, except for certain differences in the warrants included in the Private Placement Units (the Private Placement Warrants) as disclosed in the IPO Closing 8-K and in the Companys
initial registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-231337) as declared effective by the SEC on June 5, 2019. 
The Unit Purchase Agreements and the Share Purchase Agreement provided for a second closing (the Second Closing) of the Private Placement
if the underwriters exercised their option to purchase the Over-Allotment Units, which closing would take place concurrently with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units. Accordingly, on June 13, 2019, the Second Closing of the Private Placement
was consummated, resulting in the purchase of an aggregate of 75,000 additional Private Placement Units by the Founders at a purchase price of $10.00 per additional Private Placement Unit, and the purchase of an additional 20,000 Private Underwriter
Shares at a cost of $10.00 per additional Private Underwriter Share by Northland. Among the Founders, Sponsor purchased 63,730 additional Private Placement Units, EarlyBird purchased 3,900 additional Private Placement Units, and Northland Investment
purchased 7,350 additional Private Placement Units. The Second Closing of the Private Placement generated additional aggregate gross proceeds of $950,000. 
Item 8.01. Other Events.  As previously disclosed in
the IPO Closing 8-K, the Company consummated its IPO of 15,000,000 units (the Public Units) on June 10, 2019. Each Public Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value
(Common Stock), one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock (Public Warrant), and one right to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of one share of Common Stock upon the
Companys completion of an initial business combination. Each Public Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per full share. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, and the IPO
generated aggregate gross proceeds of $150,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional Public Units (the Over-Allotment Units) solely
to cover over-allotments, if any. On June 11, 2019, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, and on June 13, 2019 the underwriters purchased an additional 2,250,000 Over-Allotment Units, generating additional gross
proceeds of $22,500,000.00.  An audited balance sheet as of June 10, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the
Private Placement (excluding the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the Second Closing of the Private Placement) has been issued by the Company and is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1. 
The Companys unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of June 13, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and
the Second Closing of the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.2.
