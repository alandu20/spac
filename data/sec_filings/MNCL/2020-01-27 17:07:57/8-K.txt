Facility will mature on (a) the fourth (4th) anniversary of the closing date (the “Closing Date”) of

Monocle and NewCo, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank, National Association as the commitment parties thereunder, is
extended to after the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the earlier of (i) the scheduled maturity date of the ABL
Facility and (ii) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor
