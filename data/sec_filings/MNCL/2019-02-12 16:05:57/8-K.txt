Item 3.02.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

On February 11, 2019,
simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of units (“Units”) of Monocle
Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”), the Company consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”)
of an aggregate of 717,500 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total gross
proceeds of $7,175,000, to Monocle Partners, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Cowen Investments II LLC (“Cowen Investments”).
No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the Private Placement. The Private Placement was conducted as
a non-public transaction and, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering, is exempt from registration under
the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the “Securities Act”).
In the Private Placement, the Sponsor purchased 591,334 Private Units and Cowen Investments purchased 126,166 Private Units. The
Private Units are identical to the Units, except that if held by the original holder or their permitted assigns, the underlying
warrants (i) may be exercised on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to redemption and (iii) with respect to private warrants
held by Cowen Investments, will not be exercisable more than five years after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement
(as such terms are defined in Item 8.01 below). If the Private Units are held by holders other than the initial purchasers or their
permitted transferees, then the warrants included in the Private Units will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the
holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO. In addition, the Private Units (and the securities
underlying the Private Units) will, subject to certain limited exceptions, be subject to transfer restrictions until after the
completion of the Company’s initial business combination.

 

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers;
Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

 

Effective as of February
6, 2019, the following individuals were appointed to the board of directors of the Company: Sai S. Devabhaktuni, C. Robert Kehler,
Donald W. Manvel and John C. Pescatore. Additional information regarding, among other things, each individual’s background,
board committee membership and compensatory arrangements is contained in the Registration Statement and is incorporated by reference
herein.

 

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On February 6, 2019,
the Company filed its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which was effective the same day. Among other things, the Certificate of Incorporation
authorizes the issuance of up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”),
and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The terms of the Certificate of Incorporation are set
forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Certificate of Incorporation
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Incorporation, which is attached as Exhibit 3.1
hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

 

Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On February 11, 2019, the Company completed
its IPO of 17,250,000 Units, including the issuance of 2,250,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of
their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”).
Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Company
completed its IPO pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-228470) (the
“Registration Statement”). The Registration Statement was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
on February 6, 2019 (the “Effective Date”).	

 

In connection with the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement and the closing of the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements:

 


·An Underwriting Agreement, dated February 6, 2019, between the Company and Cowen and Company, LLC (“Cowen”), as
representative of the several underwriters;

 




     2 
     
    

 


·A Business Combination Marketing Agreement, dated February 6, 2019, among the Company, Cowen and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC;

 


·A Warrant Agreement, dated February 6, 2019, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”);

 


·A Letter Agreement, dated February 6, 2019, among the Company, the Sponsor, Cowen Investments and each of the officers and
directors of the Company;

 


·An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated February 6, 2019, between the Company and Continental;

 


·A Unit Purchase Agreement, dated February 6, 2019, between the Company and the Sponsor;

stockholders party thereto; and

 


·An Administrative Services Agreement, dated February 6, 2019, between the Company and Monocle Management LLC.

 

A total of $174,225,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s
public stockholders (the “Trust Account”), with Continental acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal of interest
to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the Trust Account will be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the
completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the
Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete an initial
business combination within the required time period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’
rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of 100% of the Company’s public shares if the
Company is unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period.

 

In connection with
the IPO, the Company issued press releases announcing the pricing and closing of the IPO, copies of which are attached hereto as
