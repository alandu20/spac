The information provided in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this
Item 3.02.   


Item 8.01.
 Other Events. 
On July 16, 2019, the Company consummated the initial public offering (IPO) of 23,000,000 of its units
(Units), including 3,000,000 Units subject to the underwriters over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (Class A Common
Stock) and one-third of one redeemable warrant (Warrant), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per
share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000.  Simultaneously with the
consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (Private Placement) of 4,233,333 Warrants (Private Warrants) at a price of $1.50 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of
$6,350,000. The Private Warrants were purchased by Pivotal Investment Holdings II LLC, the Companys sponsor and an affiliate of certain of the Companys officers and directors. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold
in the IPO, except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchaser or its permitted transferees.
The purchaser of Private Warrants has agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Warrants or Class A Common Stock underlying the Private Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of
the Companys initial business combination.  An audited balance sheet as of July 16, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds
received by the Company in connection with the consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. A
copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
