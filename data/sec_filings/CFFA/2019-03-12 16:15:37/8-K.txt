5.02           Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements
of Certain Officers.

 

On
March 11, 2019, the board of directors (the “Board”) of CF Finance Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the
“Company”) elected each of Steven Bisgay, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Robert Sharp as a Class
I director of the Company. Mr. Sharp was appointed as a member of the Company’s Audit Committee and Compensation Committee,
replacing Mr. de Castro as a member of each such committee. The Board has determined that Mr. Sharp qualifies as an independent
director under rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.

 

In
addition, on March 11, 2019, Henrique de Castro resigned as the Chief Operating Officer of the Company and as a member of the
Board and its committees to pursue other professional interests.

 

Robert
G. Sharp has over 25 years of experience in corporate acquisitions and strategically building equity value, combining financial
and operational expertise. Since January 2014, Mr. Sharp has been Co-CEO of Ramy Brook, a contemporary fashion brand. Mr. Sharp
was a founding partner and member of the Executive Committee of MidOcean Partners, a leading private equity firm, from February
2003 to December 2013. From September 1999 to February 2003, Mr. Sharp was a Managing Director at DB Capital Partners, the private
equity division of Deutsche Bank, which was acquired out of Deutsche Bank to form MidOcean Partners. Mr. Sharp joined DB Capital
Partners from Investcorp International, a global private equity firm. Mr. Sharp has served on numerous corporate boards throughout
his career, and is currently Chairman of Thomas Scientific, a supplier of laboratory products and services. Mr. Sharp is a member
of the Advisory Board of Mount Sinai Hospital, and a member of the Steering Committee of Duke University’s Financial Economics
Center. Mr. Sharp received his B.A. in Economics, Phi Beta Kappa, Summa Cum Laude, from Union College, and his M.B.A in Finance
from Columbia University, where he was a Samuel Bronfman Fellow. We believe that Mr. Sharp is qualified to serve as a member of
our board of directors due to his extensive investment and management experience.

 

No
family relationships exist between Mr. Bisgay or Mr. Sharp and any other directors or executive officers of the Company. There
are no arrangements between Mr. Bisgay or Mr. Sharp and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Bisgay or Mr. Sharp, respectively,
was nominated as a director of the Company. There are no transactions to which the Company is or was a participant and in which
Mr. Bisgay or Mr. Sharp has a material interest subject to disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
