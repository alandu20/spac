8.01. Other Events.

 

Over-Allotment Closing 

        

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of CF Finance Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), on December 17, 2018, the Company
consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 25,000,000 units (the “Units”).
Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A
Common Stock”), and three-quarters of one redeemable warrant of the Company (a “Warrant”), with each
whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. Only whole
warrants are exercisable. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000.
The Company granted Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“Cantor”), the representative of the several underwriters in
the IPO, a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, on December 31, 2018, Cantor partially exercised the over-allotment option and
purchased 2,500,000 Units (the “Initial Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $25,000,000. On
January 29, 2019, Cantor partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 758,413 units (together with
the Initial Over-Allotment Units, the “Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $7,584,130.

 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to a private placement units
purchase agreement with CF Finance Holdings LLC (the “Sponsor”), the Company completed the private sale of an
aggregate of 600,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement
Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,000,000.

 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to a promissory note issued
by the Company to the Sponsor, the Sponsor loaned $2,500,000 to the Company. As previously reported on a Current Report on Form
8-K of the Company, simultaneously with the closing in connection with the initial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option on December 31, 2018, the Sponsor loaned an additional $250,000 to the Company. Simultaneously with the closing in connection
with the second exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option on January 29, 2019, the Sponsor loaned an additional
$75,841.30 (together with the loans made at the closing on December 17, 2018 and December 31, 2018, the “Sponsor Loans”).
The proceeds of the Sponsor Loans were added to the trust account described below and the Sponsor Loans will be repaid or converted
into Units at a conversion price of $10.00 per Unit, at the Sponsor’s discretion, only upon consummation of the Company’s
initial business combination.

 

In addition, the
7,187,500 shares of Class B common stock of the Company (the “Founder Shares”) held by the Sponsor and one
other shareholder (prior to the exercises of the over-allotment) included an aggregate of up to 937,500 Founder Shares
subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in
full, so that the Sponsor and the other holder of Founder Shares would together own 20.0% of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock of the Company. Since the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part and purchased
3,258,413 of the total possible 3,750,000 Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor forfeited 122,897 Founder Shares on January 29,
2019. The Founder Shares forfeited by the Sponsor were cancelled by the Company.

 

A total of $285,409,971.30,
comprised of $276,584,130 of the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, $6,000,000 of the proceeds of
the sale of the Private Placement Units and $2,825,841.30 of the proceeds from the Sponsor Loans, was placed in a U.S.-based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of December 17, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO, the Private Placement Units and
the Sponsor Loan made on the same day has been issued by the Company and previously filed as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on
Form 8-K on December 21, 2018. The Company’s unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, reflecting receipt
of the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the Sponsor Loan made on the same day was previously filed as Exhibit
99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K on January 7, 2019. The Company’s pro forma balance sheet as of January 29, 2019, reflecting
receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the additional Over-Allotment Units and the additional Sponsor Loan made on the same day
is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 




     
     
    

 

Separate Trading of Units, Class
A Common Stock and Warrants

 

On January 29, 2019,
the Company announced that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade shares of the Class A Common Stock and Warrants
comprising the Units commencing on January 31, 2019. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market
under the symbol “CFFAU,” and the Class A Common Stock and Warrants that are separated will trade on The Nasdaq
Capital Market under the symbols “CFFA” and “CFFAW,” respectively. Holders of Units will need to have their
brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate Units
into shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants. No fractional Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole
Warrants will trade.

 

A copy of the press
release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the sale of the Over-Allotment Units on January 29, 2019 and commencement
of separate trading is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
