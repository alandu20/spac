Item 5.02.
 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  On June 18, 2020, the board of directors (the Board)
of CF Finance Acquisition Corp. (the Company) increased the size of the Board to seven and appointed Paul Pion, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, as a Class II director of the Company. The Board expects to appoint an
independent director to the Board in the near future.  Paul Pion, 53, has served as U.S. Chief Administrative Officer and Senior Managing
Director of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. since August 2011. In this position, Mr. Pion oversees a range of functions for Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. (Cantor) and its affiliates, most notably client management, cost control,
procurement, and vendor management. Other responsibilities include business continuity planning, facilities and insurance. In addition, Mr. Pion is the Treasurer of the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund. Additionally, since January 2012,
Mr. Pion has served as Chief Executive Officer of Tower Bridge International Services LP, a subsidiary of Cantor that is responsible for the back-office functions under a shared-services model for all Cantor
UK-based businesses. In addition, Mr. Pion has served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and a director of each of Rodin Global Property Trust, Inc. and Rodin Income Trust, Inc. since January 2020.
Mr. Pion previously served in numerous positions for Cantor, including Global Director of Internal Audit and was involved in various special projects from 2002 to 2010. Prior to joining Cantor, Mr. Pion served for approximately 14 years
with the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, most recently as an Audit and Assurance partner focusing on financial services clients. At Deloitte & Touche, Mr. Pion also led the New York offices China Practice.
Mr. Pion holds Series 7 and 27 licenses and is a Certified Public Accountant in the State of New York. He received a B.S. in Accounting from the State University of New York at Albany. We believe that Mr. Pion is qualified to serve as a
member of our board of directors due to his extensive accounting and management experience.  No family relationships exist between
Mr. Pion and any other directors or executive officers of the Company. There are no transactions to which the Company is or was a participant and in which Mr. Pion has a material interest subject to disclosure under Item 404(a) of
Regulation S-K.
