Item 3.01.
 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
 On June 22, 2020, CF Finance Acquisition Corp. (the Company) notified the Nasdaq Stock Market
(Nasdaq) that, as a result of the appointment of Paul Pion, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, to the board of directors of the Company (the Board) on June 18, 2020, the Company is temporarily not in compliance
with the continued listing requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 regarding the composition of the Board, because a majority of the Board is not comprised of independent directors. 
On June 23, 2020, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq acknowledging the Companys
non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605. The Nasdaq letter further provided that consistent with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1)(A), Nasdaq will provide the Company with a cure period in order to regain
compliance with such rule until the earlier to occur of (i) its next annual stockholders meeting or June 18, 2021; or (ii) if the next annual stockholders meeting is held before December 15, 2020, then the Company must
evidence compliance no later than December 15, 2020.  The Company expects to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 prior to
the expiration of the cure period provided by Nasdaq.
