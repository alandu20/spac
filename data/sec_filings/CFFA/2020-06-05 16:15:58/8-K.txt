Item 8.01
 Other Events. 
CF Finance Acquisition Corp. (the Company) previously announced that it will hold a special meeting of stockholders on
Monday, June 15, 2020 at 4:00 P.M. Eastern (the Special Meeting) to vote to further extend the deadline to consummate an initial business combination from June 17, 2020 to September 17, 2020 (the
Extension).  On June 5, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing that if the Companys
stockholders approve the Extension at the Special Meeting, CF Finance Holdings, LLC, the Companys sponsor (Sponsor), will contribute to the Companys trust account $0.09 for each share of Class A common stock
(each, a Public Share) issued in the Companys initial public offering (IPO) that is not redeemed in connection with the stockholder vote for the Extension. The Contribution will not accrue interest and
will be repayable to the Sponsor or its designee in full upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Contribution will increase the pro rata portion of the funds available in the Companys trust account from approximately
$10.33 per Public Share to approximately $10.42 per Public Share. The Contribution is conditioned upon the implementation of the Extension. If the Extension is implemented, the Sponsor will make the Contribution by June 17, 2020.
The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated into this Item 8.01 by reference.
