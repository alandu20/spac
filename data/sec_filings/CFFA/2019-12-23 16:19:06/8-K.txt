Item 3.01.
 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
 On December 17, 2019, CF Finance Acquisition Corp. (the Company) was notified by the staff
of the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) that the Staff had determined to initiate procedures to delist the Companys securities due to the Companys
non-compliance, following the termination of the phase-in period, with the majority independent board and audit committee composition requirements set forth in Nasdaq
Listing Rules 5605(b)(1) and 5605(c)(2), respectively, (collectively, the Rules) which procedures will be stayed once the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel). 
On December 19, 2019, the Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which request served to stay any such delisting action by
Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing process. Based on discussions with the Staff, the Company expects Nasdaq to cancel the hearing and any delisting actions provided the Company complies with the Rules prior to the hearing date. The Company
expects to comply with the Rules prior to the hearing date by electing a new independent director by early January 2020 along with reducing the number of sponsor-related (and therefore non-independent) directors to two in which case the Company
would request that the Staff confirm the Companys compliance status and, upon such confirmation, the hearing and such delisting actions would be canceled.   


Item 5.02
 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  On December 20, 2019, Steven Bisgay informed the Board of his
intention to resign as director and Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective as of January 1, 2020. The Company has identified a strong candidate for the Chief Financial Officer position who is currently awaiting Board approval. 
 


Item 5.07.
 Submission of Matters to Vote of Security Holders. 
On December 18, 2019, the Company held its 2019 annual meeting of stockholders (the Meeting). At the Meeting,
stockholders (i) re-elected three directors to serve as the Class I directors on the Board until the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified and
(ii) ratified the selection by the audit committee of the Board of WithumSmith+Brown, PC (Withum) to serve as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Set forth below are the final voting results for each of the proposals:
