Item 3.01.

Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
 
On January 8, 2020, CF Finance Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) was notified by the Office of General Counsel of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that, as a result of the Company complying with the majority independent board and audit committee composition requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(b)(1) and 5605(c)(2), respectively, the Company’s scheduled hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel has been cancelled and the Company’s securities will continue to be listed and trade on Nasdaq.
 




Item 5.02.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On January 6, 2020, the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company elected Robert Hochberg as a Class I director of the Company. Mr. Hochberg was appointed as a member of the Company’s Audit Committee, replacing Mr. Jain as a member of such committee. The Board has determined that Mr. Hochberg qualifies as an independent director under the rules of Nasdaq. 
 
Robert J. Hochberg, 57, is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of Numeric Computer Systems, Inc. Mr. Hochberg has served as President since June 1984 and as Chief Executive Officer since November 1994. Numeric Computer Systems is a global software company with offices in New York, San Juan, Auckland, Jakarta and Sydney. Additionally, Mr. Hochberg currently serves on the Board of Directors of Rodin Income Trust, Inc. Mr. Hochberg is a graduate of Vassar College, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. We believe that Mr. Hochberg’s extensive experience in business management supports his appointment to our Board.
 
In addition, on January 6, 2020, the Board appointed Paul Pion as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Pion will be the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Company. 
 
Paul Pion, 53, has served as U.S. Chief Administrative Officer and Senior Managing Director of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. since August 2011. In this position, Mr. Pion oversees a range of functions for Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. (“Cantor”) and its affiliates, most notably client management, cost control, procurement, and vendor management. Other responsibilities include business continuity planning, facilities and insurance. In addition, Mr. Pion is the Treasurer of the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund. Additionally, since January 2012, Mr. Pion has served as Chief Executive Officer of Tower Bridge International Services LP, a subsidiary of Cantor that is responsible for the back-office functions under a shared-services model for all Cantor UK-based businesses. Mr. Pion previously served in numerous positions for Cantor, including Global Director of Internal Audit and was involved in various special projects from 2002 to 2010. Prior to joining Cantor, Mr. Pion served for approximately 14 years with the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, most recently as an Audit and Assurance partner focusing on financial services clients. At Deloitte & Touche, Mr. Pion also led the New York office’s China Practice. Mr. Pion holds Series 7 and 27 licenses and is a Certified Public Accountant in the State of New York. He received a B.S. in Accounting from the State University of New York at Albany. Since his appointment, Mr. Pion continues with his roles at Cantor and its affiliates.
 
No family relationships exist between Mr. Hochberg or Mr. Pion and any other directors or executive officers of the Company. There are no transactions to which the Company is or was a participant and in which Mr. Hochberg or Mr. Pion has a material interest subject to disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
