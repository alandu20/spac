Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
May 21, 2020, in connection with the previously disclosed Loan Commitment Agreement dated March 19, 2019, between Insurance Acquisition
Corp. (“we,” “us” or the “Company”) and Insurance Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”),
we entered into a convertible promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) with Cohen & Company, LLC (the “Lender”),
an affiliate of the Sponsor. Pursuant to the Promissory Note, the Lender agreed to loan us up to an aggregate principal amount
of $750,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and due on the date on which we consummate a business combination. If
we do not consummate a business combination, we may use a portion of any funds held outside the trust account to repay the Promissory
Note; however, no proceeds from the trust account may be used for such repayment. If such funds are insufficient to repay the
Promissory Note, the unpaid amounts would be forgiven. All or a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Promissory Note may
be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the Lender. The warrants would be identical to the
Company’s placement warrants. On May 21, 2020, we borrowed $350,000 under the Promissory Note.
