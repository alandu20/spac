Item
1.01 Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On June 29, 2020, Insurance
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”) among the Company, IAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Shift Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Shift”),
providing for, among other things, and subject to the conditions therein, the combination of Shift and the Company pursuant to
the proposed merger of Merger Sub with and into Shift with Shift continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”).

 

The
Merger Agreement

 

Merger

 

As
a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Shift common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Shift Common
Stock”), will be converted into the right to receive newly issued shares of the Company’s Class A common
stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Company Common Stock”), as calculated pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement.

 

Consideration

 

Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration (“Merger Consideration”) to be paid by the Company to
the stockholders of Shift (the “Shift Stockholders”) in the Merger will consist of (i) 38,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) 6,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock (the “Additional Shares”) that will be deposited into an escrow account at the closing
of the Merger (the “Closing”). If the reported closing sale price of the Company Common Stock does not exceed
$12.00 per share for 20 out of any 30 consecutive trading days during the first 12 months following the Closing (the “First
Threshold”), then 3,000,000 Additional Shares will be returned to the Company (and either placed into treasury or retired,
in the discretion of the Company). If the First Threshold is reached, such Additional Shares will be released from escrow to the
respective Shift Stockholders that are the holders thereof. If the reported closing sale price of the Company Common Stock does
not exceed $15.00 per share for 20 out of any 30 consecutive trading days during the first 30 months following the Closing (the
“Second Threshold”), then fifty percent (50%) of the Additional Shares will be returned to the Company (and
either placed into treasury or retired, in the discretion of the Company). If the Second Threshold is reached, such Additional
Shares will be released from escrow to the respective Shift Stockholders that are the holders thereof. The Shift Stockholders
are entitled to vote all of the Additional Shares while they are held in escrow.

 

Redemption
Offer

 

Pursuant
to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement,
the Company will be providing its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem, upon the Closing, their respective shares
of Company Common Stock for cash equal to the applicable pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit as of two (2) business
days prior to the consummation of the Merger in the Company’s trust account (which holds the proceeds of the Company’s
initial public offering, less taxes payable).

 

Representations,
Warranties and Covenants

 

Each
of Shift, the Company and Merger Sub have made representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement that are customary
for transactions of this nature. The representations and warranties of the Company, Merger Sub and Shift will not survive the
Closing.

 

Conditions
to Consummation of the Merger

 

Consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including, among
others, that (i) the Merger be approved by the Company’s stockholders and the Shift Stockholders; (ii) there has been no
material adverse effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that is continuing with respect to Shift or the Company since the
date of the Merger Agreement; (iii) the filings of the Company and Shift pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended, shall have been made and the applicable waiting period and any extension thereof will have expired or
been terminated; (iv) the Company will have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets immediately following the Closing (after
giving effect to the redemption of public shares by the Company’s public stockholders, the PIPE Investment (as defined below)
and the other transactions contemplated to occur upon the Closing); and (v) Parent shall have at least $100,000,000 in cash and
cash equivalents after giving effect to the Closing (taking into account, among other things, the exercise by the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock issued in the Company’s initial public offering of securities and outstanding immediately before
the Closing of their right to redeem such shares into a pro rata share of the Trust Account in accordance with the Company’s
certificate of incorporation).

Termination

 

The
Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the Merger by mutual written consent of the Company
and Shift and in certain other limited circumstances, including if the Merger has not been consummated by December 31, 2020 (as
such date may be extended pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the “Outside Date”).

 

The Company may also
terminate the Merger Agreement if Shift does not deliver to the Company within twenty business days following the date of the Merger
Agreement a voting agreement of the Shift Stockholders in support of the Merger, or the consolidated financial statements of the
Company Entities as of December 31, 2019, audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
together with its auditor’s signed opinion on such financial statements. In addition, the Company may terminate the Merger
Agreement if Shift delivers a final, signed quality of earnings report from Deloitte LLP that demonstrates, as determined by an
independent third party to be chosen by Shift and the Company, that the draft quality of earnings report provided to the Company
in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement contained a material misstatement of fact, or omitted to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not materially misleading; provided, that the Company must elect to so terminate
within fifteen business days of receiving such final quality of earnings report.

 

If
the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, no party thereto will have any liability or any further obligation to any other party
under the Merger Agreement, with certain limited exceptions, including liability for any intentional and willful breach of the
Merger Agreement.

 

Additional
Agreements to be Executed at Closing

 

The Merger Agreement
provides that, upon consummation of the Merger, the Company will enter into (1) a letter agreement with Insurance Acquisition
Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Dioptra Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively,
“Sponsor”) providing for certain board observer rights in favor of Sponsor, and clarifying that existing restrictions
on transfer on Sponsor’s shares of Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Class B Stock”)
apply to the shares of Company Common Stock issued to Sponsor upon conversion of such shares of Class B Stock, which will occur
automatically upon the consummation of the Merger, and (2) a letter agreement with each of the Shift Stockholders providing for
certain restrictions on transfer applicable to the shares of Company Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration.

 

The Merger Agreement
has been unanimously approved by the Company’s board of directors, and the board has recommended that the Company’s
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger.

 

The
Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date
of such agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made
for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to
by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement
are also modified in part by the underlying disclosure schedules which are not filed publicly and which are subject to a contractual
standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to stockholders and were used for the purpose of allocating risk
among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. The Company does not believe that these schedules contain information
that is material to an investment decision. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should
not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state
of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

 

This
description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

 

Voting
Agreement

 

The Merger
Agreement provides that Shift will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, within ten business days after the date of the
Merger Agreement, a duly executed Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) from Shift Stockholders
holding shares of the capital stock of Shift in such number as is necessary to obtain the Shift Stockholder Vote, pursuant to
which the Shift Stockholders party thereto will agree to, among other things, vote all of the securities of Shift
beneficially owned or held by such stockholder (their “Voting Shares”) (i) in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) in favor of
any proposal to adjourn or postpone to a later date any meeting of the Shift Stockholders if there are not sufficient votes
to approve the Merger; (iii) against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement which could reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Shift under the Merger
Agreement; (iv) against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger or the fulfillment of the
applicable conditions of Shift under the Merger Agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any class of shares of
Shift (including any amendments to Shift’s organizational documents); and (v) against any alternative acquisition
proposal or transaction. Sponsor will also sign and deliver the Voting Agreement, and pursuant thereto will agree to, among
other things, vote all of the securities of the Company beneficially owned or held by Sponsor (its “Voting
Shares”) (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone to a later date any meeting of the
Company’s Stockholders if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger; (iii) against any action, proposal,
transaction or agreement which could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty
or any other obligation or agreement of the Company or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement; (iv) against any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely
affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger or the fulfillment of the applicable conditions of the Company under
the Merger Agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any class of shares of the Company (including any
amendments to the Company’s organizational documents, except as required by the Merger Agreement); and (v) against any
alternative acquisition proposal or transaction.

The Voting Agreement
generally prohibits the Sponsor and the Shift Stockholders party thereto from transferring, or permitting to exist any liens on,
their Voting Shares prior to the consummation of the Merger, other than to certain permitted transferees who become party to, and
bound by, the Voting Agreement. The Voting Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Closing
and (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

This
description of the Voting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions
of the Voting Agreement, a form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

 

PIPE
Subscription Agreements

 

Concurrently
with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, certain institutional accredited investors (the “PIPE
Investors”), including affiliates of Sponsor, entered into subscription agreements (the “PIPE Subscription
Agreements”) pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to subscribe for and purchase up to 18,500,000
shares of Company Common Stock (the “PIPE Shares”) at a purchase price per share of $10.00. In addition,
an affiliate of the Sponsor is permitted under its PIPE Subscription Agreement to purchase up to an additional 1,300,000 PIPE
Shares, subject to certain limitations. The purchase of the PIPE Shares will be consummated concurrently with the
Closing.

 

This
description of the PIPE Subscription Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms
and conditions of the form of PIPE Subscription Agreement, a form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated
herein by reference.

in connection with the Merger and will mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to its stockholders.
The Company’s stockholders and other interested persons are advised to read, when available, the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus,
and amendments thereto, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus in connection with the Company’s solicitation of proxies
for its stockholders’ meeting to be held to approve the Merger because the proxy statement/prospectus will contain important
information about the Company, Shift and the Merger. The definitive proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to stockholders
of the Company as of a record date to be established for voting on the Merger. Stockholders will also be able to obtain copies

Participants
in Solicitation

 

The
Company, Shift and certain of their respective directors and officers may be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies
of the Company’s stockholders with respect to the approval of the Merger. Information regarding the Company’s directors
and officers and a description of their interests in the Company is contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Additional information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation, including
Shift’s directors and officers, and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise,
will be included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus for the Merger when available.
Each of these documents is, or will be, available at the SEC’s website or by directing a request to the Company as described
above under “Additional Information About the Transaction and Where to Find It.”

 

In
connection with the Merger, at any time prior to the special meeting to approve the Merger, certain existing Company stockholders,
which may include certain of the Company’s officers, directors and other affiliates, may enter into transactions with stockholders
and other persons with respect to the Company’s securities to provide such investors or other persons with incentives in
connection with the approval and consummation of the Merger. While the exact nature of such incentives has not yet been determined,
they might include, without limitation, arrangements to purchase shares from or sell shares to such investors and persons at nominal
prices or prices other than fair market value. These stockholders will only effect such transactions when they are not then aware
of any material nonpublic information regarding the Company, Shift or their respective securities.

 

Forward
Looking Statements

 

This
Current Report on Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor”
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of
words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “continue”, “expect”,
“estimate”, “may”, “plan”, “outlook”, “future” and “project”
and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.
These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts
of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to the Company’s and Shift’s future
prospects, developments and business strategies. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning
the timing of the Merger; the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the public company once the transaction
is complete, and Shift’s estimated and future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry
environment and potential growth opportunities. These statements are based on the Company’s or Shift’s management’s
current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events.

 

Such
forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many
of which are outside the Company’s or Shift’s control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors include,
but are not limited to, (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination
of the Merger Agreement; (2) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement due to the failure
to obtain approval of the stockholders of the Company or other conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement; (3) the ability
of the public entity to meet Nasdaq’s listing standards following the Merger; (4) the inability to complete the private
placement; (5) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of Shift as a result of the announcement
and consummation of the transactions described herein; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction,
which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably,
maintain relationships with suppliers and agents and retain its management and key employees; (7) costs related to the proposed
transaction; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations and delays in obtaining, adverse conditions contained in, or the inability
to obtain necessary regulatory approvals required to complete the potential transaction; (9) the possibility that Shift may be
adversely affected by other economic, business, regulatory and/or competitive factors; (10) the outcome of any legal proceedings
that may be instituted against the Company, Shift or any of their respective directors or officers, following the announcement
of the potential transaction; and (11) the failure to realize anticipated pro forma results and underlying assumptions, including
with respect to estimated stockholder redemptions and purchase price and other adjustments.

 




     4 
     
    

 

Additional
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements can
be found in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K, subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
current reports on Form 8-K, which are available, free of charge, at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, and will also
be provided in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 and the Company’s proxy statement/prospectus when available. New risks
and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. You
are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and the Company
and Shift undertake no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

 

This
communication is not intended to be all-inclusive or to contain all the information that a person may desire in considering
an investment in the Company and is not intended to form the basis of an investment decision in the Company. All subsequent written
and oral forward-looking statements concerning the Company and Shift, the proposed transaction or other matters and attributable
to the Company and Shift or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
above.

 

Disclaimer

 

This
communication shall neither constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there
be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration
or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
