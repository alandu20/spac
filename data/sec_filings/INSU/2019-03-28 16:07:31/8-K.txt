Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On March 22, 2019, Insurance
Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of
15,065,000 units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 1,965,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’
exercise of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one half of one warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”),
each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share,
subject to adjustment as provided in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, initially filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on February 19, 2019 (File No. 333-229741). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $150,650,000.

 

On March 22, 2019, simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate
of 425,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”). 375,000 of the Private Placement Units were sold to the Company’s
sponsor, Insurance Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, and 50,000 Private Placement Units were sold to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. at a purchase
price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $4,250,000.

 

A total of $150,650,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (which includes approximately $6.4 million of the underwriters’
deferred discount) were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, acting as trustee. The remaining proceeds were designated for IPO expenses and operational use.

 

An audited balance sheet
as of March 22, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
