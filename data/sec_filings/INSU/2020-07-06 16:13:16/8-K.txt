EXPLANATORY
NOTE

 

This
Amendment No. 1 (this “Amendment”) to the Current Report on Form 8-K originally filed on June 29, 2020 (the “Original
8-K”) is filed by Insurance Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), for the sole purpose
of correcting an inadvertent error on the cover page of the Original 8-K. The error was that the row for reporting the Company’s
warrants (Trading Symbol: INSUW) (the “Warrants”) in the table under the heading “Securities registered pursuant
to Section 12(b) of the Act” incorrectly stated that the Warrants are exercisable to purchase one-half of one share of the
Company’s Class A common stock. The Amendment corrects such table to state that the Warrants are exercisable for one share
of the Company’s Class A common stock. There is no other amendment to the Original 8-K or its exhibits made by this Amendment.
