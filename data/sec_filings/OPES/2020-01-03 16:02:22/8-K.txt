Item
3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard.

 

On January 2, 2020, Opes Acquisition Corp. (the
“Company”) received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market
(“Nasdaq”) stating that the Company failed to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within 12 months
after its fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5810(c)(2)(G), the Company has 45 calendar days (or until February 17, 2020) to submit a plan to regain compliance and,
if Nasdaq accepts the plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company up to 180 calendar days from its fiscal year end, or until June 29,
2020, to regain compliance. The Company intends to submit a compliance plan within the specified period. While the plan is
pending, the Company’s securities will continue to trade on Nasdaq.

Statements contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K that are
not historical facts may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or the Company’s future

“intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions
that concern the Company’s expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Such forward-looking statements may relate to, among other
things, the Company’s continued efforts and ability to regain and maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Such forward-looking
statements do not constitute guarantees of future performance and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. The Company
does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or developments
or otherwise.
