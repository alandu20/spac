Item 5.07.Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

On January 15, 2020, Opes Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “Meeting”). At the Meeting,
the Company’s stockholders considered the following proposals:

1.                  
A proposal to adopt and approve an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the
“charter”) to extend the date that the Company has to consummate a business combination (the “Extension”)
to March 	16, 2020 (the “Extended Date”). The following is a tabulation of the votes with respect to this
proposal, which was approved by the Company’s stockholders:



    For
    Against
    Abstain
    Broker Non-Votes

    10,122,588
    0
    0
    0

 

In connection with this vote, the holders of 18,133 shares of the
Company’s common stock properly exercised their right to convert their shares into cash at a conversion price of approximately
$10.52 per share, for an aggregate conversion amount of approximately $190,800.

 

Following the Meeting, the Company filed the
amendment to the charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. A copy of the amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit
3.1.

 

Upon filing of the amendment to the charter,
the Company deposited into its trust account established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering $0.0325
for each public share that was not converted in connection with the Extension, or an aggregate of approximately $291,561, for the
first 30-day extension period. The Company now has until February 17, 2020 to consummate an initial business combination, or determine
to deposit additional funds into the trust account for one additional 30-day extension period.

 

2.       A
proposal to adopt and approve the early winding up of the Company and redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if the
Company’s board of directors determines at any time prior to the Extended Date that the Company will be unable to consummate
an initial business combination by the Extended Date. The following is a tabulation of the votes with respect to this proposal,
which was approved by the Company’s stockholders:
