Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement



 

Business
Combination Agreement and Plan of Reorganization

 

On
July 10, 2020, Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Spartan”), Spartan Merger Sub Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Spartan (“Merger Sub”), and Fisker Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the “Company”), entered into a business combination agreement and plan of reorganization (the “Business
Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger,”
together with the other transactions related thereto, the “Proposed Transactions”), with the Company surviving
the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Spartan (the “Surviving Corporation”).

 

Conversion
of Securities

 

Immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the Company will cause each share of the
Company’s preferred stock (“Company Preferred Stock”) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time to be automatically converted into a number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (“Company
Class A Common Stock”) in accordance with the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation dated
December 10, 2018 (the “Company Charter”), and each converted share of Company Preferred Stock will no longer
be outstanding and will cease to exist, such that each holder of Company Preferred Stock will thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such securities.

 

Also
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cause the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest due
on the Company’s outstanding convertible notes (“Company Convertible Notes”) immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be automatically converted into a number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of such Company Convertible Notes, and such converted Company Convertible Notes will no longer be outstanding and will cease to
exist.

 

Also
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cause the convertible equity security of the Company (the “Company
Convertible Equity Security”) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be automatically
converted into 5,882,352 shares of Company Class A Common Stock. The Company Convertible Equity Security that is converted into
shares of Company Class A Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will cease to exist, and each holder of the Company Convertible
Equity Security will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such security.

 

At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Spartan, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders
of any of the Company’s securities:

 


(a)Each
share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares of
Company Class A Common Stock resulting from the conversion of the Company Convertible Equity Security) will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive the number of shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Spartan (“Spartan
Class A Common Stock”) equal to the Exchange Ratio. The “Exchange Ratio” means the following ratio (rounded
to four decimal places): the quotient obtained by dividing the Company Merger Shares by the Company Outstanding Shares. The “Company
Merger Shares” means a number of shares equal to (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) $1,750,000,000, as adjusted pursuant
to the Business Combination Agreement, by (B) $10.00, minus (ii) the number of shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock ultimately
issuable to the holder of the Company Convertible Equity Security, plus (iii) the number of Sponsor Shares (as defined
below). The “Company Outstanding Shares” means the total number of shares of Company Common Stock (as defined below)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, expressed on a fully-diluted and as-converted to Company Common Stock basis,
and including, without limitation or duplication, the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock (x) issuable upon conversion
of the Company Preferred Stock and Company Convertible Notes, (y) that would be issuable upon conversion of the shares of Company
Founders Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time at the then-effective conversion rate as calculated
pursuant to the Company Charter, and (z) subject to unexpired, issued and outstanding the Company Options (as defined below),
and excluding the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Company Equity Security;

(b)Each
                                         share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time resulting from the conversion of the Company Convertible Equity Security will be canceled
and converted into the right to receive one share of Spartan Class A Common Stock;

 


(c)Each
share of the Company’s Class B common stock (together with the Company Class A Common Stock, the “Company Common
Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right
to receive the number of shares of newly authorized Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Spartan, carrying voting
rights in the form of 10 votes per such share (“Spartan Class B Common Stock”) equal to the Exchange Ratio;

 


(d)Each
                                         share of the Company Founders Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
                                         Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the number of shares of
                                         Spartan Class B Common Stock equal to the product of (rounded up or down to the nearest
                                         whole number, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up) (i) the number of shares of Company
                                         Class A Common Stock that would have been issuable upon the conversion of such share
                                         of Company Founders Stock at the then-effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant
                                         to the Company Charter and (ii) the Exchange Ratio;

 


(e)All
                                         shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Company Founders Stock and the
                                         Company Convertible Equity Security held in the treasury of the Company will be canceled
                                         without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect
                                         thereto;

 


(f)Each
                                         share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
                                         immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and exchanged for one
                                         validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.00001
                                         per share, of the Surviving Corporation;

 


(g)Each
                                         unexpired, issued and outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Class A Common
                                         Stock, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested (“Company Option”)
                                         that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested,
                                         will be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Spartan Class A Common
                                         Stock (such option, an “Exchanged Option”) equal to the product (rounded
                                         up or down to the nearest whole number, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up) of (i) the
                                         number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately
                                         prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
                                         (rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent, with a fraction of $0.005 rounded up)
                                         equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company Option immediately prior
                                         to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically
                                         provided in the Business Combination Agreement, following the Effective Time, each Exchanged
                                         Option will continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting
                                         and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former Company Option
                                         immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 


(h)No
                                         certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Spartan Class A Common
                                         Stock or Spartan Class B Common Stock will be issued upon the exchange of Company Common
                                         Stock or Company Founders Stock. Any fractional shares will be rounded up or down to
                                         the nearest whole share of Spartan Class A Common Stock or Spartan Class B Common Stock,
                                         as applicable, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash settlements will be made with

Stock
Exchange Listing

 

Spartan
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Proposed
Transactions to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange at the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”).
Until the Closing, Spartan will use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Spartan Class A Common Stock and warrants listed for
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

 

Registration
Rights Agreement

 

In
connection with the Closing, that certain Registration Rights Agreement dated August 9, 2018 (the “IPO Registration Rights
Agreement”) will be amended and restated and Spartan, certain persons and entities holding securities of Spartan prior
to the Closing (the “Initial Holders”) and certain persons and entities receiving Spartan Class A Common Stock
or Spartan Class B Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (the “New Holders” and together with the Initial Holders,
the “Reg Rights Holders”) will enter into that amended and restated IPO Registration Rights Agreement attached
as an exhibit to the Business Combination Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement, Spartan will agree that, within 30 calendar days after the Closing, Spartan will file with the
SEC (at Spartan’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of certain securities held by or
issuable to the Initial Holders and certain of the New Holders (the “Founders Registration Statement”), and
Spartan will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Founders Registration Statement declared effective as soon as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof. Additionally, Spartan will agree that, as soon as reasonably practicable after Spartan is
eligible to register the Reg Rights Holders’ securities on a registration statement on Form S-3, Spartan will file with
the SEC (at Spartan’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of certain securities held
by or issuable to the New Holders that were not included on the Founders Registration Statement (the “New Holders Registration
Statement”) and Spartan will use its reasonable best efforts to have the New Holders Registration Statement declared
effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. In certain circumstances, the Reg Rights Holders can demand
up to three underwritten offerings and will be entitled to customary piggyback registration rights.

 

The
foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form
of Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is included as Exhibit A to the Business Combination Agreement, filed as Exhibit

upon conversion of such shares of Spartan Class B Common Stock, or any shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock issuable upon the

settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise or (c) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction
specified in clause (a) or (b) (the actions specified in clauses (a)-(c), collectively, “Transfer”) for 180

Exclusivity

 

From the date of
the Business Combination Agreement and ending on the earlier of (a) the Closing and (b) the termination of the Business Combination

of Spartan, the parties will not, and will cause their respective subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) enter into, knowingly solicit, initiate or continue any discussions or negotiations with, or knowingly
encourage or respond to any inquiries or proposals by, or participate in any negotiations with, or provide any information to,
or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person or other entity or “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act, concerning any sale of any material assets of such party or any of the outstanding capital stock or any conversion,
consolidation, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving such party or any of such party’s subsidiaries
other than with the other parties to the Business Combination Agreement and their respective representatives (an “Alternative
Transaction”), (ii) enter into any agreement regarding, continue or otherwise knowingly participate in any discussions
regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way that would otherwise reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Alternative Transaction or (iii) commence, continue or renew any due diligence investigation regarding
any Alternative Transaction; provided that the execution, delivery and performance of the Business Combination Agreement and related
documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will not be deemed a violation of this provision. Each
party will, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective affiliates and representatives to, immediately cease
any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction.
Each party also agrees that it will promptly request each person (other than the parties hereto and their respective representatives)
that has prior to the date thereof executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an Alternative
Transaction to return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such person by or on behalf of it prior to the date
thereof (to the extent so permitted under, and in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement). If a party or
any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective representatives receives any inquiry or proposal with respect to an
Alternative Transaction at any time prior to the Closing, then such party will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
such party becomes aware of such inquiry or proposal) notify such person in writing that such party is subject to an exclusivity
agreement with respect to the Proposed Transactions that prohibits such party from considering such inquiry or proposal, but only,
in the case of Spartan, to the extent not inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Spartan.

                                         of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually
                                         or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in more than de minimis additional

Termination

 

The
Business Combination Agreement may be terminated and the Proposed Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time, notwithstanding any requisite approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and the Proposed Transactions
by the stockholders of the Company or the Spartan Stockholders, as follows:

 


(a)By
                                         mutual written consent of Spartan and the Company;

 


(b)By
                                         Spartan or the Company, if (i) the Effective Time will not have occurred prior to the
                                         date that is 180 days after the date of the Business Combination Agreement (the “Outside
                                         Date”); provided, however, that the Business Combination Agreement may not
                                         be terminated by or on behalf of any party that either directly or indirectly through
                                         its affiliates is in breach or violation of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
                                         or obligation contained therein and such breach or violation is the principal cause of
                                         the failure of a condition to the Merger on or prior to the Outside Date, and, in the
                                         event that any law is enacted after the execution of the Business Combination Agreement
                                         extending the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the Outside Date will be automatically
                                         extended by the length of any such extension; (ii) any governmental authority in the
                                         United States has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order,
                                         decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which has become final
                                         and nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Proposed Transactions
                                         illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Proposed Transactions,
                                         including the Merger; or (iii) any of the Spartan Proposals fail to receive the requisite
                                         vote for approval at the Spartan Stockholders’ Meeting;

 


(c)By
                                         the Company if there is an occurrence of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
                                         or agreement on the part of Spartan and Merger Sub set forth in the Business Combination
                                         Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Spartan and Merger Sub will have become
                                         untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in representations and warranties
                                         and the agreements and covenants of Merger Sub and Spartan specified in the conditions
                                         to the Merger section of the Business Combination Agreement would not be satisfied (“Terminating
                                         Spartan Breach”); provided that the Company has not waived such Terminating
                                         Spartan Breach and the Company is not then in material breach of their representations,
                                         warranties, covenants or agreements in the Business Combination Agreement; provided,
                                         however, that, if such Terminating Spartan Breach is curable by Spartan and Merger Sub,
                                         the Company may not terminate the Business Combination Agreement under this section for
                                         so long as Spartan and Merger Sub continue to exercise their reasonable efforts to cure
                                         such breach, unless such breach is not cured within thirty days after notice of such
                                         breach is provided by the Company to Spartan; or

(d)By
                                         Spartan if (i) the Company has failed to deliver the Written Consent to Spartan one business day of execution of the Business Combination Agreement; or (ii) there is an
                                         occurrence of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
                                         part of the Company set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, or if any representation
                                         or warranty of the Company has become untrue, in either case such that the conditions
                                         set forth in representations and warranties and the agreements and covenants of the Company
                                         specified in the conditions to the Merger section of the Business Combination Agreement
                                         would not be satisfied (“Terminating Company Breach”); provided that
                                         Spartan has not waived such Terminating Company Breach and Spartan and Merger Sub are
                                         not then in material breach of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
                                         in the Business Combination Agreement; provided further that, if such Terminating Company
                                         Breach is curable by the Company, Spartan may not terminate the Business Combination
                                         Agreement under this provision for so long as the Company continues to exercise its reasonable
                                         efforts to cure such breach, unless such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days
                                         after notice of such breach is provided by Spartan to the Company.

entered into a Sponsor Agreement with Spartan pursuant to which Sponsor will, immediately prior to, and conditioned upon, the
Effective Time, automatically and irrevocably surrender and forfeit to Spartan, for no consideration and as a contribution to
the capital of Spartan, 441,176 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value of $0.0001 per share, of Spartan (the “Sponsor
Shares”), whereupon the Sponsor Shares will be canceled.

 

The
foregoing description of the Sponsor Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the Sponsor
Agreement, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.

 

Subscription
Agreements

 

In
connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on July 10, 2020, Spartan entered into separate subscription
agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with a number of investors (collectively, the “Subscribers”),
pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed to purchase, and Spartan agreed to sell to the Subscribers, an aggregate of 50,000,000
shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock (the “PIPE Shares”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an
aggregate purchase price of $500,000,000, in a private placement (the “PIPE”).

The closing of the sale of the PIPE Shares
pursuant to the Subscription Agreements is contingent upon, among other customary closing conditions, the concurrent consummation
of the Proposed Transactions. The purpose of the PIPE is to raise additional capital for use by the combined company following
the Closing.

 

Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements,
Spartan agreed that, within 30 calendar days after the consummation of the Proposed Transactions, Spartan will file with the SEC
(at Spartan’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the PIPE Shares (the “PIPE
Resale Registration Statement”), and Spartan will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the PIPE Resale Registration
Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof.

 

The foregoing description of the Subscription
Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the Subscription Agreement, a copy of which
is included as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.

 

 Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.



 

The disclosure set forth above in Item
1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein. The securities of Spartan that may be issued in connection
with the Merger and the Subscription Agreements will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”) in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation
D promulgated thereunder.

 

 Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.



 

On July 13, 2020,
Spartan and the Company issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Business Combination Agreement. A copy of
the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A conference call by management of Spartan
and the Company (the “Conference Call”) can be accessed via the following link: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=140790.
A copy of the script for the Conference Call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference. Such exhibits
and the information set forth therein will not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise
be subject to the liabilities of that section, nor will it be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act.

 

Attached as Exhibit
99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference is an investor presentation relating to the Proposed
Transactions. Such exhibit and the information set forth therein will not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the
Exchange Act, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section, nor will it be deemed to be incorporated by reference
in any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

 

In addition to the risks set forth under “Forward-Looking
Statements” below, the Company and Spartan caution you that the Company’s business is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including the following:
the Company has a limited operating history under its current business model and has not yet sold any production vehicles to customers;
the Company’s electronic mobility as a service business model is unproven; the Company has incurred losses in the operation
of its business and anticipates that it will continue to incur losses in the future; the Company may never achieve or sustain profitability;
the Company’s vehicles are in development and it does not expect its first vehicle to be produced until the fourth quarter
of 2022, if at all; if Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and its subsidiaries choose to not do business with the Company, then it would
have significant difficulty in procuring and producing its vehicles and its business prospects would be significantly hindered;
while the Company has memorandums of understanding in place with certain third parties relating to aspects of its business, it
does not currently have arrangements in place that will allow it to fully execute its business plan, including, without limitation,
final supply and manufacturing agreements and fleet service and management agreements; the market for the Company’s vehicles
is nascent and not established; the dual class structure of the Company’s common stock following the Closing will have the
effect of concentrating voting control with the Company’s co-founders and following the Proposed Transactions, the combined
company’s Class B common stock will have 10 votes per share, and the combined company’s Class A common stock will have
one vote per share, resulting in the holders of the combined company’s outstanding Class B common stock will hold a majority
of the voting power of the combined company’s outstanding capital stock following the Closing; following the Closing, the
combined company’s Class B common stock will be beneficially owned by Henrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta, who are the Company’s
CEO and CFO, respectively and this will give the combined company’s CEO and CFO, who are husband and wife, the ability to
control the election of directors and limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.

of Spartan are urged to read the proxy statement and the other relevant materials when they become available before making any

Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Current Report on Form 8-K includes
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act. All statements, other than statements of present or historical fact included in this Current Report on Form 8-K,
regarding Spartan’s proposed acquisition of the Company and Spartan’s ability to consummate the transaction, are forward-looking
statements. When used in this Form 8-K, the words “could,” “should,” “will,” “may,”
“believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,”
the negative of such terms and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all
forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current
expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing
of future events. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, Spartan and the Company disclaim any duty to update any forward
looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances
after the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. Spartan and the Company caution you that these forward-looking statements are
subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of
either Spartan or the Company. In addition, Spartan cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained in this Current
Report on Form 8-K are subject to the following factors: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could
delay the Proposed Transactions or give rise to the termination of the agreements related thereto; (ii) the outcome of any legal
proceedings that may be instituted against Spartan or the Company following announcement of the Proposed Transactions; (iii) the
inability to complete the Proposed Transactions due to the failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of Spartan, or other
conditions to closing in the agreements related to the Proposed Transactions; (iv) the risk that the Proposed Transactions disrupt
Spartan’s or the Company’s current plans and operations as a result of the announcement of the Proposed Transactions;
(v) the Company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Transactions, which may be affected by, among
other things, competition and the ability of the Company to grow and manage growth profitably following the Proposed Transactions;
(vi) costs related to the Proposed Transactions; (vii) changes in applicable laws or regulations; and (viii) the possibility that
the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Should one or more of the risks
or uncertainties described in this Current Report on Form 8-K, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results
and plans could different materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning
these and other factors that may impact the operations and projections discussed herein can be found in Spartan’s periodic
filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Spartan’s SEC
filings are available publicly on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
