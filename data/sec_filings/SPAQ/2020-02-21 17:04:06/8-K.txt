Item 3.01Notice of Delisting or
Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 

On February 20, 2020,
John J. MacWilliams resigned as a member of the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the
“Board”) of Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”). Mr. MacWilliams’s resignation from
the Audit Committee reduced the number of directors currently serving on the Audit Committee to two, rendering the Company noncompliant
with New York Stock Exchange Listing Rule 303A.07(a) (“Rule 303A.07(a)”), which requires that the Audit Committee be
composed of a minimum of three independent members.

 

On February 20, 2020,
the Company advised the New York Stock Exchange of Mr. MacWilliams’s resignation from the Audit Committee, its consequences
with regard to compliance with Rule 303A.07(a) and the Company’s intention to regain compliance with Rule 303A.07(a) as soon
as reasonably practicable.

 

The Board is currently
in the process of identifying a qualified candidate to fill the Audit Committee seat that was vacated by Mr. MacWilliams’s
resignation.
