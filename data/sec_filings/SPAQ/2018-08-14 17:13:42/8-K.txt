    Item 3.02
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities



 

On
August 14, 2018, simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of Spartan Energy
Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) and pursuant to a Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement dated August
9, 2018 by and between the Company and the Company’s sponsor, Spartan Energy Acquisition Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”),
the Company completed the private sale of 9,360,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase
price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $14,040,000. The Private
Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units (as defined below) in the IPO, except that the Private
Placement Warrants will not be redeemable by the Company and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held
by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. The Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement
Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business
combination. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).

On
August 9, 2018, effective simultaneously with the effectiveness of the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (File
No. 333-226274) (the “Registration Statement”), John M. Stice and Robert C. Reeves were appointed as members
of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”). The Board has determined that Messrs. Stice and Reeves
are “independent directors” as defined in the NYSE listing standards and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “Commission”) rules and will serve on the audit, compensation and nominating and governance committees
with Mr. Stice serving as chair of the audit committee and Mr. Reeves serving as chair of the compensation and nominating and
governance committees. Each of Messrs. Stice and Reeves will receive a one-time cash retainer of $150,000 and purchased 150,000
shares of Class B common stock of the Company from the Sponsor. In connection with their appointment the Company entered into
an indemnification agreement with each of Messrs. Stice and Reeves which requires the Company to indemnify these individuals to
the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as
to which they could be indemnified. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
Indemnification Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated in this
Item 5.02 by reference.

 



    Item 5.03

The
Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as so amended, the “Certificate of Incorporation”)
was approved on August 9, 2018. A description of the Certificate of Incorporation is contained in the section of the prospectus,
dated August 9, 2018 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (the “Prospectus”), entitled
“Description of Capital Stock” and is incorporated herein by reference. The description is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Incorporation, which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report
on Form 8-K and is incorporated into this Item 5.03 by reference.

    Item 8.01
    Other Events.



 

On
August 14, 2018, the Company completed its IPO of 55,200,000 units (the “Units”), including 7,200,000 Units
that were issued pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option. The Units were issued pursuant
to an underwriting agreement, dated August 9, 2018, among the Company, on the one hand, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, on the other hand, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. Each Unit
had an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share
(the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one warrant of the Company (each such whole warrant, a “Warrant”).
Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share.

 

Of
the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, $552,000,000, including $19,320,000 of deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions, has been deposited into a U.S. based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
that may be released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of
the Private Placement Warrants held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur
of (a) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination (including the release of funds to pay any amounts due
to any public stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights in connection therewith), (b) the redemption of any public
shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that
would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares if
the Company does not complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (c) the redemption
of the Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete its business combination within 24 months from the closing
of the IPO, subject to applicable law.
