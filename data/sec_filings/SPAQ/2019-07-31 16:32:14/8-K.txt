On
July 30, 2019, John J. MacWilliams was appointed as a member of the board of directors (the “Board”) of Spartan Energy
Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), effective immediately. The Board has determined that Mr. MacWilliams is an “independent
director” as defined in the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing standards and applicable Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and regulations.

 

Under
the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, the Company had one year from the date of its initial public offering to
have the Board’s Audit Committee be comprised solely of independent members. Prior to Mr. MacWilliams’s appointment,
one of the members of the Board’s Audit Committee, Geoffrey Strong, was not independent. In connection with Mr. MacWilliams’s
appointment to the Board, Mr. MacWilliams will replace Mr. Strong as a member of the Board’s Audit Committee.

 

John
J. MacWilliams, age 63, served as the Associate Deputy Secretary and Chief Risk Officer of the U.S. Department of Energy (the
“DOE”) from August 2015 until January 2017 and as Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the DOE from June 2013 until
August 2015. Prior to his appointment to the DOE, Mr. MacWilliams was Managing Partner at Tremont Energy Partners, LLC, a private
investment and advisory firm specializing in the global energy industry. Mr. MacWilliams co-founded Tremont Energy in 2004 after
serving as Vice Chairman, Investment Bank, at JP Morgan Chase and Partner at JP Morgan Partners from 2000 until 2003. Previously,
Mr. MacWilliams was a founding partner in 1993 of The Beacon Group, LLC. Mr. MacWilliams’s prior positions include Executive
Director of Goldman Sachs & Co.’s International Banking Division, Vice President for Goldman Sach & Co.’s
Private Finance Group, and attorney at Davis Polk & Wardwell. Mr. MacWilliams has served on Boards of Directors for Alliance
Resource Partners, LP, Compagnie Generale de Geophysique, Longhorn Partners Pipeline, LP, SmartSync, Inc, Soft Switching Technologies,
Inc., and Titan Methanol Company. Since 2017, Mr. MacWilliams has served as a Senior Advisor for the Boston Consulting Group,
a Fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy and Adjunct Professor at Columbia’s School of International
and Public Affairs. Mr. MacWilliams holds a B.A. from Stanford University, an M.S. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and a J.D. from Harvard Law School. Mr. MacWilliams is well-qualified to serve as director due to his extensive experience in
the global energy industry, including his substantial energy-related experience in both the private and public sectors.

 

In
connection with his appointment to the Board, Mr. MacWilliams has joined the Letter Agreement, dated August 9, 2018, among the
Company, its officers and directors and its sponsor by entering into an Insider Letter Acknowledgment and Agreement, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. Please see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2018 for information regarding the Letter Agreement. The Company also entered into an Indemnification Agreement with Mr. MacWilliams,
a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, which requires the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
under Delaware law and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against him as to which he could be indemnified.

 

In
connection with his appointment to the Board, Mr. MacWilliams will receive a one-time cash retainer of $75,000. In addition, Mr.
MacWilliams will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Company’s behalf
such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.

 

On
July 30, 2019, the Company’s sponsor transferred 75,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, to Mr. MacWilliams at their original purchase price.
