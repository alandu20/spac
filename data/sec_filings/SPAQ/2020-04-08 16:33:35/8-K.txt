    Item
5.02
    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

 

On April 7, 2020, John
J. MacWilliams resigned from the board of directors (the “Board”) of Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”).
Mr. MacWilliams’s resignation was not a result of any disagreement with the Company.

 

On April 7, 2020, Jan
C. Wilson was appointed as a member of the Board to fill the vacancy occurring in the Board as a result of Mr. MacWilliams’s
resignation. The Board has determined that Ms. Wilson is an “independent director” as defined in the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) listing standards and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and
regulations.

 

As previously disclosed
in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on February 21, 2020, the Company was previously not compliant
with NYSE Listing Rule 303A.07(a) (“Rule 303A.07(a)”), which requires that the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit
Committee”) be composed of a minimum of three independent members. In connection with her appointment to the Board, Ms. Wilson
has been appointed to the Audit Committee, which has brought the Company back into compliance with Rule 303A.07(a).

 

Jan C. Wilson, age 47,
served as a consultant to the Royal Bank of Canada from September 2015 until April 2017. Prior to her service as a consultant to
the Royal Bank of Canada, Ms. Wilson was a manager at Enron Corporation from May 1996 until January 2002, senior vice president
of RBS Sempra Commodities LLC from January 2002 until January 2011 and director of Freepoint Commodities LLC from June 2011 until
June 2013. Since April 2018, Ms. Wilson has served as a senior advisor for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and is the
founder/president of JW 1000 Ltd. a company focused on advising on all project contracts that are required to support financing
and allocation of risk for sustainable energy projects. Ms. Wilson was a private investor from March 2015 to August 2015 and from
April 2017 through March 2018. Ms. Wilson holds a B.A. in Economics and a B.A. in Honours Business Administration from the University
of Western Ontario and an M.B.A. from Queens University. Ms. Wilson is well-qualified to serve as director due to her extensive
experience in risk management and asset acquisition in the electricity, oil & gas and energy storage industries.

 

In connection with her
appointment to the Board, Ms. Wilson has joined the Letter Agreement, dated August 9, 2018, among the Company, its officers and
directors and its sponsor by entering into an Insider Letter Acknowledgment and Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit 10.1. Please see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for information regarding
the Letter Agreement. The Company also entered into an Indemnification Agreement with Ms. Wilson, a copy of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit 10.2, which requires the Company to indemnify her to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and to advance
expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against her as to which she could be indemnified.

 

In connection with her
appointment to the Board, Ms. Wilson will receive a one-time cash retainer of $37,500. In addition, Ms. Wilson will be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Company’s behalf such as identifying potential
target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.

 

On April 7, 2020, the
Company’s sponsor transferred 37,500 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to
Ms. Wilson at their original purchase price.
