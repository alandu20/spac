Item 8.01 Other Events. 

 

Separate Trading of Units, Class A Common
Stock and Warrants

As previously reported
on Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed on March 4, 2019 and March 18, 2019, DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. (the “Company”)
consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of an aggregate of 28,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each
Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”),
and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof
to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $280,000,000.

On April 12, 2019,
the Company issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, announcing
that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade shares of the Class A Common Stock and Warrants comprising the
Units commencing on April 15, 2019. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol
“DPHCU,” and the Class A Common Stock and Warrants that are separated will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market
under the symbols “DPHC” and “DPHCW,” respectively. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation
of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of the Units will need to have their brokers contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into shares of Class A Common Stock and
Warrants.
