Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

 

On
March 4, 2019, DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 25,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company,
par value $0.0001 per share ( “Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company
(“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock
for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000.
The Company has granted the underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up to
3,750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate
of 4,666,667 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to DiamondPeak Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”)
and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (the “Anchor Investor”), at a purchase price of $1.50 per
Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,000,000. The Sponsor has committed to purchase up to
an additional 500,000 Private Placement Warrants if the Underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full.

 

A
total of $250,000,000, comprised of $245,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $8,750,000 of the Underwriters’
deferred discount) and $5,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of March 4, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement
has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
