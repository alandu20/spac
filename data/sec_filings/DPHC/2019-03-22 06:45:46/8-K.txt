Item 8.01. Other Events. 

 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. (the “Company”), on March 4, 2019, the Company consummated
its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 25,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists
of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share ( “Class A Common Stock”),
and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit,
generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”)
a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On March 18, 2019, the Underwriters
partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 3,000,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”),
generating gross proceeds of $30,000,000.

 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale
(the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 4,666,667 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”)
to DiamondPeak Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc., at a purchase
price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,000,000. In connection with the Underwriters’
partial exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 400,000 Private Placement Warrants, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $600,000.

 

In addition, the 6,375,000
shares of Class B common stock of the Company (the “Founder Shares”) held by the Sponsor (prior to the exercises of
the over-allotment) included an aggregate of up to 937,500 Founder Shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that
the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full, so that the Sponsor and the other holders of Founder Shares
would together own 20.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of common stock of the Company. Since the underwriters
exercised the over-allotment option in part and purchased 3,000,000 of the total possible 3,750,000 Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor
forfeited 187,500 Founder Shares on March 18, 2019. The Founder Shares forfeited by the Sponsor were cancelled by the Company.

 

A total of $280,000,000,
comprised of $274,400,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $9,800,000 of the Underwriters’ deferred discount)
and $5,600,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee. 

 

An audited balance
sheet as of March 4, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
by the Company and previously filed as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K on March 8, 2019. The Company’s unaudited
pro forma balance sheet as of March 18, 2019, reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and
the Private Placement consummated on the same day is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
