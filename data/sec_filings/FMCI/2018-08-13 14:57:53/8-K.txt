Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

On
August 7, 2018, Forum Merger II Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company,
par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”),
with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were
sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $200,000,000. The Company has granted the underwriters
for the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments,
if any.

 

On
August 7, 2018, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private
Placement”) of an aggregate of 655,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”). 555,000 of the Private
Placement Units were sold to Forum Investors II LLC (the “Sponsor”) and 100,000 Private Placement Units were
sold to the Underwriters at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of
$6,550,000. The Sponsor has committed to purchase up to an additional 45,000 Private Placement Units and the Underwriters up to
an additional 15,000 Private Placement Units if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full.

 

A
total of $200,000,000, comprised of $196,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $7,000,000 of the underwriters’
deferred discount) and $4,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of August 7, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement
has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
