    Item 5.03
    Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

         

On June 8, 2020, Forum
Merger II Corporation (the “Company”) filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an amendment (the
“Extension Amendment”) to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to
extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization
or similar business combination with one or more businesses from June 10, 2020 to September 30, 2020 (the “Extension”).
The Company’s stockholders approved the Extension Amendment at a special meeting of stockholders of the Company (the “Special Meeting”)
on June 8, 2020. The foregoing description of the Extension Amendment is qualified in its entirety
by the full text of the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

  



    Item 5.07
    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

 

On June 8, 2020, at the Special Meeting,
a total of 18,495,348 (or 72.11%) of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common
stock held of record as of May 13, 2020, the record date for the Special Meeting, were present either in person or by proxy,
which constituted a quorum. The Company’s stockholders voted on the following proposals at the Special Meeting, each
of which were approved. The final vote tabulation for each proposal is set forth below.

 



     
    1.
    To approve and adopt the Extension Amendment.

Although this proposal would have received sufficient
votes to be approved, no motion to adjourn was made because the adjournment of the Special Meeting was determined not
to be necessary or appropriate.

 



    Item 7.01
    Regulation FD Disclosure.

 

In connection with the Extension,
none of the Company’s public shares were redeemed. As a result, approximately $207.4 million remains in the trust account.

 

On June 8, 2020 the Company issued a press release
announcing that the Extension Amendment was approved at the Special Meeting. A copy of the press release is furnished
as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 

The information in this Item 7.01 and Exhibit
99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed
incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as
expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
