 Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
On November 7, 2019, the Registration Statement
on Form S-1 (File No. 333-234264) (the Registration Statement) relating to the initial public offering (the IPO) of
Juniper Industrial Holdings, Inc. (the Company) was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On November 13, 2019 the Company consummated the IPO of 34,500,000 units (the Units), which includes

(the Class A Common Stock), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the Public Warrants), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of
Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000. Further, in connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following
agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:

warrant (the Private Placement Warrants);   


 

 
 a Warrant Agreement, dated November 13, 2019, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer &

redemption and cashless exercise of the Warrants; certain registration rights of the holders of Warrants; provision for amendments to the Warrant Agreement; and indemnification of the warrant agent by the Company under the agreement;

obligations of the Sponsor; and pursuant to which the Company has agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of the Sponsor; and 
 


 

 
 an Administrative Services Agreement, dated November 13, 2019, by and between the Company and the Sponsor,
pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to make available office space and certain administrative and support services, as may be required by the Company from time to time, for $10,000 per month until the Companys initial business combination

 The above descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the
applicable agreement, each of which is incorporated by reference herein and filed herewith as Exhibits 1.1, 10.1, 4.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5 respectively. 
Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. 
Simultaneous with the consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale of the Units, the Company consummated the private placement of
10,150,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $10,150,000 (the Private Placement). The Private Placement Warrants, which were purchased by the Sponsor, are
substantially similar to the Public Warrants, except that if held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, they (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption under certain
redemption scenarios and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of the Companys initial business combination. If the Private Placement Warrants are
held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company under all redemption scenarios and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Private
Placement Warrants have been issued pursuant to, and are governed by the Warrant Agreement.  Item 5.03. Amendments to Memorandum and Articles of
Association.  On November 7, 2019, the Company adopted its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.  Item 9.01. Financial Statements
