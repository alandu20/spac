On December 17, 2019, Juniper Industrial Holdings, Inc. (the Company) announced that the holders of the Companys units
(the Units) may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class A common stock), and warrants included in the Units commencing on December 20, 2019. Each
Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock. Any Units not separated will continue to trade on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol JIH.U. Any underlying shares of Class A common stock and warrants that are separated will trade on the NYSE under the symbols JIH and JIH WS, respectively.
No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Companys transfer agent,
in order to separate the holders Units into shares of Class A common stock and warrants.  A copy of the press release issued by
the Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
