Item 8.01Other Events.

 

On February 19, 2020, Churchill Capital
Corp III (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 110,000,000
units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 10,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise
of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001
per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-fourth of one warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”),
each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share,
subject to adjustment as provided in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, initially filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2020 (File No. 333-236153). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $1,100,000,000.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO,
the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 23,000,000 warrants (the
 “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s
sponsor, Churchill Sponsor III LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of $23,000,000.
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has
agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30
days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable
by the Company so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.

 

A total of $1,100,000,000 was placed
in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay permitted working
capital withdrawals and to pay its taxes, the proceeds from the IPO will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any
public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if the
Company does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO (or 27 months from
the closing of the IPO if the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO), and (iii) the redemption of all of the
Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete its business combination within 24 months (or 27 months upon the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in (ii)) from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.

 

In connection with the IPO, the Company
entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s Registration Statement:

 


·An Underwriting Agreement, dated February 13, 2020, among the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representative
