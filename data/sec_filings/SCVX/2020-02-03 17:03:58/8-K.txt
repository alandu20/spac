Item 8.01Other Events.

 

On January 28, 2020, SCVX Corp. (the “Company”)
consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 23,000,000 units (the “Units”), including
the issuance of 3,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s exercise of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists
of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (an “Ordinary Share”), and one-half
of one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for $11.50
per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of
$230,000,000.

 

Substantially concurrently with the closing of the IPO, the
Company completed the private sale of 6,600,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price
of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s sponsor, SCVX USA LLC, generating gross proceeds to the Company
of $6,600,000.

 

A total of $230,000,000, comprised of proceeds from the IPO
and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. An audited balance sheet as of January 28, 2020 reflecting
receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants has been issued by the Company
and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
