                                         Events.

 

On
January 28, 2020, SCVX Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 23,000,000 units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 3,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s
exercise of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per
share (an “Ordinary Share”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles
the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price
of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $230,000,000.

 

Substantially
concurrently with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of 6,600,000 warrants (the “Private
Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s sponsor, SCVX
USA LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,600,000. The Private Placement Warrants
are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its
permitted transferees: (1) they will not be redeemable by the Company; (2) they (including the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise
of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Sponsor until 30 days
after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination; (3) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless
basis; and (4) they (including the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights.

 

A
total of $230,000,000, comprised of proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, were placed in a U.S.-based
trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes,
if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (1) the
completion of the Company’s initial business combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection
with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance
or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with its initial business combination or to redeem 100%
of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the
IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity;
and (3) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if the Company has not completed its initial business combination within
24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.
