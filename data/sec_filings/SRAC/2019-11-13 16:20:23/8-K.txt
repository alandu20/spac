of 17,250,000 units (the “Units”), including 2,250,000 Units issued pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter’s
over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class
A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole
Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at
a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $172,500,000.

 

In connection with the
IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s
Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-233980) related to the IPO, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “Commission”) on September 27, 2019 (as amended, the “Registration Statement”):

Simultaneously with the
