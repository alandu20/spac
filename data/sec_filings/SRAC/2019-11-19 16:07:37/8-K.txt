    Item 8.01.
    Other
    Events.

 

On
November 13, 2019, Stable Road Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the
“IPO”) of 17,250,000 units (the “Units”), including 2,250,000 Units issued pursuant to the
exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company,
par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”) and one half of one redeemable warrant of the Company
(each whole warrant, a “Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share
of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $172,500,000. 

 

On
November 13, 2019, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private
Placement”) of an aggregate of 545,000 Units (the “Private Placement Units”), including 495,000 Private
Placement Units to SRC-NI Holdings, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and 50,000 Private Placement Units to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,450,000.

 

A
total of $172,500,000, comprised of $167,050,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $6,900,000 of the Underwriter’s
deferred discount) and $5,450,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

audited balance sheet as of November 13, 2019 reflecting the receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the
