Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On October 18, 2018,
Graf Industrial Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of
22,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001
per share (the “Common Stock”), and one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant
entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share, provided that if the Company
has not consummated its initial business combination within 15 months of the closing of the IPO, each whole Warrant will entitle
the holder thereof to purchase three-quarters of one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment in either
case. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $225,000,000.

 

On October 18, 2018,
simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”)
of 13,400,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Company’s sponsor, Graf Acquisition LLC,
at a purchase price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,700,000.

 

A total of $225,000,000,
comprised of $220,500,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $7,875,000 payable to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. (or, at the Company’s discretion, other FINRA members) pursuant to a Business Combination Marketing
Agreement, dated October 15, 2018, by and among the Company, EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.), and $4,500,000
of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank,
