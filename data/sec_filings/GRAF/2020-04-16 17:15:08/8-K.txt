Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On April 16, 2020,
Graf Industrial Corp. (the “Company”) filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, an amendment (the
 “Extension Amendment”) to the Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the
date by which the Company has to consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization
or similar business combination with one or more businesses from April 18, 2020 to July 31, 2020 (the “Extension”).
The Company’s stockholders approved the Extension Amendment at a special meeting in lieu of the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders
of the Company (the “Special Meeting”) on April 16, 2020. The foregoing description of
the Extension Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Extension Amendment, filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.

 


Item 5.07Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

 

On April 16, 2020, at the Special Meeting,
a total of 24,965,099 (81.93%) of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock held of record as of March
19, 2020, the record date for the Special Meeting, were present either in person or by proxy, which constituted a quorum. The Company’s
stockholders voted on the following proposals at the Special Meeting, each of which were approved. The final vote tabulation for
each proposal is set forth below.

Although this proposal would have received
sufficient votes to be approved, no motion to adjourn was made because the adjournment of the Special Meeting was determined not
to be necessary or appropriate.

 

After giving effect to the redemption of
12,921,275 shares of the Company’s common stock in connection with the Extension, there is approximately $117.1 million remaining
in the Company’s trust account to consummate a business combination.
