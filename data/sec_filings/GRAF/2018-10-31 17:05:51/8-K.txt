Over-Allotment Closing 

 

As
previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K of Graf Industrial Corp. (the “Company”), on October 18, 2018,
the Company consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 22,500,000 units (“Units”), each Unit consisting
of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), and one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”),
with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share, provided
that if the Company has not consummated its initial business combination within 15 months of the closing of the IPO, each whole
Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase three-quarters of one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share, subject
to adjustment in either case. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $225,000,000.
The underwriters of the IPO were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 3,375,000 Units to cover over-allotments, if
any (“Over-Allotment Units”). On October 25, 2018, the underwriters exercised the option in part and purchased 1,876,512
Over-Allotment Units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $18,765,120.

 

As
previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, on October 18, 2018, simultaneously with the consummation
of the IPO, the Company completed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 13,400,000 warrants
(the “Placement Warrants”) to Graf Acquisition LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $6,700,000.
On October 25, 2018, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional
750,605 Placement Warrants to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $375,302.

 

In
addition, the 6,468,750 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Founder Shares”) held by the Company’s
initial stockholders (prior to the exercise of the over-allotment) included an aggregate of up to 843,750 Founder Shares
subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in
full, so that the initial stockholders would collectively own 20.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of
the Company. Since the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part and purchased 1,876,512 of the total possible
3,375,000 Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor forfeited 374,622 Founder Shares on October 25, 2018 resulting in the Sponsor and
the Company's independent directors holding an aggregate of 6,094,128 shares of Common Stock. The Founder Shares
forfeited by the Sponsor were cancelled by the Company.

 

A
total of $243,765,120 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Units) and the private
placements on October 18, 2018 and October 25, 2018 were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s
public stockholders. An audited balance sheet as of October 18, 2018 reflecting receipt of the net proceeds from the IPO and the
Private Placement on October 18, 2018, but not the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units nor the private placement
on October 25, 2018, had been prepared by the Company and previously filed on a Current Report on Form 8-K on October 24, 2018.
The Company’s unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of October 25, 2018, reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale
of the Over-Allotment Units and the private placement on the same day is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form
8-K. 

 

A
copy of the Press Release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the sale of the Over-Allotment Units is included
as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
