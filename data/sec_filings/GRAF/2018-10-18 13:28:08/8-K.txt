Graf Industrial Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 22,500,000 units

thereof to purchase one-half of one share of common stock for $11.50 per share, provided that if the Company has not consummated
its initial business combination within 15 months of the closing of the IPO, each whole Warrant will entitle the holder thereof
to purchase three-quarters of one share of common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment in either case. The Units were
sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $225,000,000.
