Item 8.01. Other Events

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 21, 2019, GreenVision Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”)
consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,750,000 units (the “Units”), inclusive of the over-allotment
option of 750,000 Units.

 

Each Unit consists one share of common
stock (“Common Stock”), one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one share of
Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon
the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds of $57,500,000.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of
the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with its sponsor, GreenVision
Capital Holdings LLC. (“Sponsor”) for the purchase of 2,100,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at
a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $2,100,000, pursuant to the Sponsor Subscription Agreement
dated September 19, 2019. In addition, the Company sold to I-Bankers Securities Inc., for $100, a share purchase warrant to
purchase up to 287,500 shares exercisable at $12.00 per share, commencing on the later of the consummation of the
Company’s initial business combination and 360 days from the effective date of the Registration Statement, pursuant to
the Share Purchase Warrant dated November 21, 2019 and expiring five year from the effective date.

 

As of November 21, 2019, a total of $57,500,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the
Company’s public shareholders.

 

An audited balance sheet as of November
21, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement is included with this report
as Exhibit 99.1.
