Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On November 18, 2019, the registration statement (File No.
333-234282) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering (“IPO”) of GreenVision
Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection
therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Registration
Statement:



     
    •
    An Underwriting Agreement, dated November 18, 2019, by and between the Company and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. (“IBankers”), as representative of the underwriters;

     
    •
    A Warrant Agreement, dated November 18, 2019, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;

     
    •
    A Rights Agreement, dated November 18, 2019, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;

     
    •
    Letter Agreements, dated November 18, 2019, by and between the Company and each of the initial shareholders, officers and directors of the Company;

     
    •
    An Investment Management Trust Agreement, November 18, 2019, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;

     
    •
    A Stock Escrow Agreement, dated November 18, 2019, by and among the Company, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and each of the initial shareholders of the Company; and

     
    •
    A Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 18, 2019, by and between the Company and the initial shareholders of the Company.



The material terms and conditions of the above agreements
of the Company are fully described in the Company’s Registration Statement as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

On November 21, 2019, the Company consummated the IPO of 5,000,000
units (the “Units”). In addition, the underwriters exercised in full the over-allotment option for an additional 750,000
Units on such date, resulting in the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 5,750,000 Units.

Each Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Share”),
one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one Share at a price of $11.50 per Share, and one right to
receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Share upon the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination.

The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit,
generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000.

In addition, the Company sold to
I-Bankers, for $100, a share purchase warrant to purchase up to 287,500 shares exercisable at $12.50 per share, commencing on
the later of the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination and   360 days from the effective date of
the Registration Statement, pursuant to the  Share Purchase Warrant dated November 21, 2019, a copy of which is
attached as Exhibit 4.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 

As of November 21, 2019, a total of $57,500,000 of the net proceeds
from the IPO and the Warrant Private Placement (as defined below in Item 3.02) were deposited in a trust account established for
the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting
as trustee, at an account at Morgan Stanley.

 

An audited balance sheet as of November 21, 2019 reflecting receipt
of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the consummation of the IPO and the Warrant Private Placement (as defined
below) will be included on a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company within four business days of the consummation
of the IPO.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the
IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with its sponsor, GreenVision Capital
Holdings LLC. (“Sponsor”) for the purchase of 2,100,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of
$1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $2,100,000, pursuant to the Sponsor Subscription Agreement dated
September 19, 2019, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.5 to the Registration Statement as filed with the
Commission.

 

The Sponsor has previously loaned the Company the sum of $411,000,
evidence by a note (as previously filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Registration Statement) which loan was payable upon the earlier
of completion of the IPO or March 30, 2020. In connection with the completion of the IPO, the Sponsor instructed the Company to
offset payment of the note with a corresponding portion of the subscription price for the Private Placement.

 

The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the IPO
except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue
to be held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. Additionally, because the Private Warrants were issued in a private transaction,
the Sponsor and its permitted transferees will be allowed to exercise the Private Warrants for cash even if a registration statement
covering the shares (2,100,000 shares) issuable upon exercise of such Private Warrants is not effective. The Sponsor has agreed
not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Warrants (or underlying Shares) (except in limited circumstances, as described
in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Sponsor was granted
certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Warrants and the original Shares
(1,377,500 shares of Common Stock). Additionally, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.4 to this Form
8-K, two directors of the Company were also granted registration rights with respect to the shares (30,000 shares each) held by
them.

 

The Private Warrants were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.

 

Item 8.01 Other Events.

 

On November 18, 2019, the Company issued a press release, a copy
of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, announcing the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement and the pricing of the IPO.
