Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

 

On February 18, 2020, Tenzing Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) held a special meeting (the “Special Meeting”) of shareholders in
lieu of the 2020 annual general meeting of shareholders. At the Special Meeting, the Company’s shareholders were asked to
vote on the following items: (i) an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the
date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from February 23, 2020 to May 26, 2020 (or June 23, 2020 if the
Company has executed a definitive agreement for a business combination by May 26, 2020) (the “Extension Proposal”);
(ii) a proposal to elect each of William I. Campbell, Vikas Thapar and Nina Shapiro as Class I directors of the Company with each
such director to serve until the second annual general meeting of shareholders following the Special Meeting or until his or her
successor is elected and qualified (the “Director Proposal”); and (iii) a proposal to direct the chairman of
the Special Meeting to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and
vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the special meeting, there are not sufficient votes to approve
the Extension Proposal or the Director Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”).

 

The affirmative vote of at least 65% of
the ordinary shares of the Company, no par value (the “Ordinary Shares”) entitled to vote which were present,
in person or by proxy, at the Special Meeting and which voted on the Extension Proposal was required to approve the Extension Proposal.
The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Ordinary Shares entitled to vote which were present, in person or by proxy,
at the Special Meeting and which voted on the Director Proposal was required for the election of each of the directors in the Director
Proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares entitled to vote which were present, in person or by proxy,
at the Special Meeting and which voted on the Adjournment Proposal was required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.


 

Set forth below are the final voting results
for the Extension Proposal and the Director Proposal. As there were sufficient votes to approve the Extension Proposal and the
Director Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal was not presented to shareholders at the Special Meeting.
