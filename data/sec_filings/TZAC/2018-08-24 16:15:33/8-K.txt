 Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive
Agreement.

  

On August 23, 2018,
Tenzing Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 5,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of the Company, no par value per
share (the “Ordinary Shares”) and one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant
entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per
Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $55,000,000. The Company has granted Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), the
underwriter of the IPO, a 45 day option to purchase up to 825,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

In connection with
the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, some of which were forms previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s
Registration Statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-226263 and 333-226952) for the IPO, originally filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on July 20, 2018 (as amended, the “Registration Statement”):

 


●An
Underwriting Agreement, dated August 20, 2018, by and between the Company and Maxim, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1.1
hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 


●A
Warrant Agreement, dated August 20, 2018, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant
agent, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 


●An
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated August 20, 2018, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, as trustee, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Maxim and the holders party thereto, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with
the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Unit Subscription Agreement, dated August 20, 2018, by and between
the Company and the Sponsor and the Unit Subscription Agreement, dated August 20, 2018, by and between the Company and Maxim,
the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 323,750 units (the “Private Placement Units”), 310,000
of which were sold to the Sponsor and 13,750 to Maxim, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross
proceeds to the Company of $3,237,500. The Private Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that warrants
that are part of the Private Placement Units are not redeemable by the Company so long as they are held by the original holders
or their permitted transferees. In addition, for as long as the warrants that are part of the Private Placement Units are held
by Maxim or its designees or affiliates, they may not be exercised after five years from the effective date of the Registration
Statement. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales. The issuance of the Private Placement
Units was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On August 20, 2018,
in connection with the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association in the British Virgin
Islands, effective the same day. The terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association are set forth
in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles
of Association is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 




     
     
    

 

Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

A total of $56,100,000,
comprised of $52,862,500 of the proceeds from the IPO and $3,237,500 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units,
was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the trust account that may be released to the
Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of
(i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Company’s public
shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and

if it does not complete its initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO or (iii) the redemption of
the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 18 months from the closing
of the IPO, subject to applicable law.
