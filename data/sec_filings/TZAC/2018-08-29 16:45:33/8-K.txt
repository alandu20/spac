On August 23,
2018, Tenzing Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of 5,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of
the Company, no par value (the  “Ordinary Shares”), and one redeemable warrant of the Company
(“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per
share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $55,000,000. 

 

On August 23, 2018,
simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”)
of an aggregate of 323,750 Units (the “Private Placement Units”), including 310,000 Private Placement Units
to Tenzing LLC and 13,750 Private Placement Units to Maxim Group LLC, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,237,500.

 

A total of $56,100,000,
comprised of $52,862,500 of the proceeds from the IPO and $3,237,500 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units,
