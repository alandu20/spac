    Item 2.03
    Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant

 

On
February 10, 2020, Tenzing Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”)
in the amount of up to $750,000.00 to Tenzing LLC (the “Sponsor”). A portion of the proceeds of the Note, which may
be drawn down from time to time until the Company consummates its initial business combination, will be used to fund a contribution
in the amount of $0.099 per ordinary share held by public shareholders that is not redeemed in connection with a shareholder vote
to extend the time that the Company has to consummate its initial business combination (the “Extension Proposal”),
which proposal will be presented at the special meeting of shareholders to be held on February 18, 2020. If no public shareholders
redeem their ordinary shares in connection with the Extension Proposal, $626,000 of the proceeds of the Note will be deposited
into the Company’s trust account. Any remaining proceeds of the Note will be used as general working capital.

 

The
Note bears no interest and is payable in full upon the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial
business combination and (ii) the date the winding up of the Company is effective (the “Maturity Date”).  A failure
to pay the principal within five business days of the Maturity Date or the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy
action shall be deemed an event of default, in which case the Note may be accelerated. The Sponsor has the option to convert any
unpaid balance of the Note into units (the “Conversion Units”), each unit consisting of one ordinary share of the Company
and one warrant exercisable for one ordinary share of the Company, based on a conversion price of $10.00 per unit, subject to adjustment.
The terms of the Conversion Units would be identical to the units issued by the Company to the Sponsor in a private placement that
was consummated in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. The Sponsor shall be entitled to certain registration
rights relating to the Conversion Units

 

The issuance of the Note was
made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 

A copy of the Note is attached
as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The disclosures set forth in this Item
2.03 are intended to be summaries only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Note.
