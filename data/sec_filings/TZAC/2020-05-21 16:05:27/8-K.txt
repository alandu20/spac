Item
                            2.03Creation
of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant

 

On
May 21, 2020, Tenzing Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”)
in the amount of up to $375,000.00 to Tenzing LLC (the “Sponsor”). A portion of the proceeds of the Note, which
may be drawn down from time to time until the Company consummates its initial business combination, will be used to fund a contribution
in the amount of $0.066 per ordinary share held by public shareholders that is not redeemed in connection with the Extension Proposal
(as defined below), which proposal was presented and approved at the completely virtual special meeting of shareholders (the “Special
Meeting”) held on May 21, 2020. $210,836.34 of the proceeds of the Note will be deposited into the Company’s trust
account. The remaining proceeds of the Note will be used as general working capital.

 

The
Note bears no interest and is payable in full upon the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial
business combination and (ii) the date the winding up of the Company is effective (the “Maturity Date”).  A
failure to pay the principal within five business days of the Maturity Date or the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy
action shall be deemed an event of default, in which case the Note may be accelerated. The Sponsor has the option to convert any
unpaid balance of the Note into units (the “Conversion Units”), each unit consisting of one ordinary share of
the Company and one warrant exercisable for one ordinary share of the Company, based on a conversion price of $10.00 per unit,
subject to adjustment. The terms of the Conversion Units would be identical to the units issued by the Company to the Sponsor in
a private placement that was consummated in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. The Sponsor shall be entitled
to certain registration rights relating to the Conversion Units.

 

The issuance of the Note was
made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 

A copy of the Note is attached
as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The disclosures set forth in this Item
2.03 are intended to be summaries only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Note.

 


Item 5.07Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.


 

At the Special Meeting, the Company’s
shareholders were asked to vote on the following items: (i) an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of
Association to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from May 26, 2020 to July 27, 2020 (or
September 28, 2020 if the Company has executed a definitive agreement for a business combination by July 27, 2020) (the “Extension
Proposal”) and (ii) a proposal to direct the chairman of the Special Meeting to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later
date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of
the special meeting, there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”).

 

The affirmative vote of at least 65% of
the ordinary shares of the Company, no par value (the “Ordinary Shares”) entitled to vote which were present,
in person or by proxy, at the Special Meeting and which voted on the Extension Proposal was required to approve the Extension Proposal.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares entitled to vote which were present, in person or by proxy, at the Special
Meeting and which voted on the Adjournment Proposal was required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.

 

Set forth below are the final voting results
for the Extension Proposal. As there were sufficient votes to approve the Extension Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal was not
presented to shareholders at the Special Meeting.

Item 7.01Regulation FD


 

The information set forth below under this
Item 7.01 is intended to be furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section,
nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except as expressly
set forth by specific reference in such filing.

 

In connection with the Extension Proposal,
shareholders of the Ordinary Shares (“Public Shares”) sold in the Company’s initial public offering elected
to redeem 2,534,624 Public Shares, which represents approximately 44% of the Public Shares that were outstanding as of April 24,
2020, the record date of the Special Meeting. Following such redemptions, approximately $34,008,726.92 will remain in the
trust account, without taking into account the additional $0.066 for each Public Share that is not redeemed to be deposited into
the trust account, and 3,194,490 Ordinary Shares will remain issued and outstanding.

 

A press release announcing the approval
of the Extension Proposal is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
