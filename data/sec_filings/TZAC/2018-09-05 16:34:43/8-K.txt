    Item 8.01.
    Other Events.

 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of Tenzing Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), on August 23, 2018, the Company
consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit
consists of one ordinary share of the Company, no par value (the “Ordinary Shares”), and one redeemable warrant
of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for
$11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $55,000,000. The
Company also granted Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), the underwriter of the IPO, a 45-day option to purchase up to
825,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-Allotment Units”). On August 30, 2018,
the underwriter exercised the option in full and purchased 825,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of $8,250,000. The Company paid a commission of $185,625 to Maxim.

 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, on August 23, 2018, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company
completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 323,750 Units (the “Private
Placement Units”), including 310,000 Private Placement Units to Tenzing LLC (the “Sponsor”) and 13,750
Private Placement Units to Maxim, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,237,500. On August 30, 2018, simultaneously with
the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 35,063 Private Placement Units, including
33,000 Private Placement Units to the Sponsor and 2,063 Private Placement Units to Maxim, generating gross proceeds of $350,630.

 

A total of $64,515,000,
comprised of $63,250,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and $1,265,000 of the proceeds of
the sales of the Private Placement Units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. 

 

An audited balance
sheet as of August 23, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement, but not
the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units nor the private placement on August 30, 2018, had been prepared by the Company
and previously filed on a Current Report on Form 8-K on August 29, 2018. The Company’s unaudited pro forma balance sheet
as of August 30, 2018, reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the private placement on
the same day is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 

A copy of the press
release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the sale of the Over-Allotment Units is included as Exhibit 99.1 to
this Current Report on Form 8-K.
