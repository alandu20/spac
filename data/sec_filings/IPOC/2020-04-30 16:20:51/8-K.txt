Item 8.01Other Events.

 

On April 24, 2020, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings
Corp. III (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 82,800,000
units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 10,800,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s exercise
of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (an
 “Ordinary Share”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles the holder
thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per
Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $828,000,000.

 

Substantially concurrently with the closing of the
IPO, the Company completed the private sale of 10,933,333 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase
price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s sponsor, SCH Sponsor III LLC, generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $16,400,000.

 

A total of $828,000,000 comprised of proceeds from
the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. An audited balance sheet as of April 24, 2020
reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants has been issued
by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
