Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On December 13, 2019,
LIV Capital Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 7,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”),
each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold
at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $70,000,000.

 

Substantially concurrently
with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 2,575,000 warrants
(the “Private Placement Warrants”) to LIV Capital Acquisition Sponsor, L.P. at a purchase price of $1.00 per
Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $2,575,000.

 

A total of $70,000,000,
comprised of $68,425,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and $1,575,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed
in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of December 13, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been
issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 

On
December 18, 2019, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,050,000 Units that were subject to the underwriter’s
over-allotment option at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $10,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale
of additional units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 236,250 Private Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private
Warrant, generating total proceeds of $236,250. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private
Warrants, an aggregate amount of $80,500,000 has been placed in the Company’s trust account established in connection with
the IPO.
