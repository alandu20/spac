Item 8.01.
Other Events.

 

On
December 13, 2019, LIV Capital Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 7,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”),
each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold
at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $70,000,000.

 

Substantially
concurrently with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of 2,575,000 warrants (the “Private
Placement Warrants”) to LIV Capital Acquisition Sponsor, L.P. (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price
of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $2,575,000. The Private Placement Warrants
are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its
permitted transferees: (1) they will not be redeemable by the Company; (2) they (including the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable
upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Sponsor
until 30 days after the completion of the initial business combination; (3) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless
basis; and (4) they (including the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration
rights.

 

A
total of $70,000,000, comprised of $68,425,000 of the proceeds from the IPO, including $2,450,000 of the underwriters’ advisory
fee in connection with the initial business combination, and $1,575,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants,
was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the trust account that may be released
to the Company to pay its taxes (and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), the funds held in the trust account
will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of all of the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete its business combination
within 21 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of the Company’s public
shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to redeem 100% of its
public shares if it does not complete an initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to shareholders' rights or pre-initial business combination activity.
