    Item 5.02.
    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

 

On November 12, 2018,
the board of directors (the “Board”) of Collier Creek Holdings (the “Company”) elected Craig
D. Steeneck to the Board as a Class II director, with a term of office expiring at the Company’s second annual meeting of
shareholders. The Board appointed Mr. Steeneck, who was determined to be an “independent director” as defined in the
applicable rules of The New York Stock Exchange, to serve as a member and as Chairman of the audit committee of the Board (the
 “Audit Committee”) and as a member of the compensation committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”).
As a result, the Audit Committee is presently comprised of Mr. Steeneck, Matthew M. Mannelly and William D. Toler, with Mr. Steeneck
serving as its Chairman, and the Compensation Committee is presently comprised of Messrs. Steeneck, Toler and Antonio F. Fernandez,
with Mr. Toler serving as its Chairman.

 

On November 12, 2018,
in connection with Mr. Steeneck’s appointment to the Board, Mr. Steeneck entered into an indemnity agreement on substantially
the same terms as the form thereof previously entered into by and between the Company and each of its other directors in connection
with the Company’s initial public offering, which was previously filed as exhibit 10.5 to the Company’s Registration
Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-227295) and is incorporated herein by reference.

 

Prior to the Company’s
initial public offering, on September 7, 2018, Mr. Steeneck entered into a forward purchase agreement with the Company which provides
for the purchase by Mr. Steeneck of 150,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company, plus 50,000 redeemable warrants to purchase
one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, for a purchase price of $1.5 million, in a private placement to close concurrently
with the closing of the Company’s initial business combination. On September 10, 2018, Collier Creek Partners LLC, the Company’s
sponsor, transferred 52,500 Class B ordinary shares of the Company to Mr. Steeneck at their original purchase price of $0.002 per
share.

 

Other than the foregoing,
Mr. Steeneck is not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any person pursuant to which he was appointed as a director,
nor is he a party to any transaction required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K involving the Company. There
are no family relationships between Mr. Steeneck and any of the Company’s other directors or executive officers.
