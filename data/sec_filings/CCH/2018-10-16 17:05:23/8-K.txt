Item 8.01.Other Events.


 

On October 10, 2018,
Collier Creek Holdings (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 44,000,000 units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 4,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’
partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value
$0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company
(“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for
$11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $440,000,000.

 

Simultaneously with
the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 7,200,000 warrants
(the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Company’s sponsor, Collier Creek Partners LLC, at a purchase
price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $10,800,000.

 

A total of $440,000,000,
comprised of $431,200,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $15,400,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount)
and $8,800,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of October 10, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been
issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
