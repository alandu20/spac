Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.


 

On October 10, 2018,
Collier Creek Holdings (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 44,000,000 units
(the “Units”), including the issuance of 4,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ partial exercise of
their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the
 “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each
whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at
a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $440,000,000.

 

In connection with
the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s
Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-227295​) for the IPO, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “Commission”) on September 12, 2018 and amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement, filed
with the Commission on September 17, 2018 (as amended, the “Registration Statement”):

Item 3.02.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.


 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the
private sale of 7,200,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50
per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $10,800,000. The Private Placement Warrants
are identical to the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has agreed not to transfer,
assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the
completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable by the
Company and are exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. No
underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was
made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
