Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
June 26, 2020, KBL Merger Corp. IV (“KBL” or the “Company”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement
(the “SPA”) whereby it issued to two institutional investors secured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate
principal amount of $3,601,966.28 (collectively, the “Notes”) for an aggregate purchase price of $3,407,521.97. A
portion of the purchase price paid by one of the investors was satisfied by surrendering a note held by such investor that was
issued by an entity that is party to the Business Combination referenced below. The Notes are subject to 10% original issue discount,
have a term of eight months, and accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum, with interest being guaranteed to the maturity
of the Notes, regardless of when any Note is converted. The Notes are all initially convertible into the Company’s common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), at a per share conversion price equal to $5.28. Beginning
ninety (90) days following the Company’s completion of its contemplated business combination, as initially reported in the
Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on July 23, 2019 (the “Business Combination”),
the conversion price will equal the lowest VWAP of the Company’s Common Stock during the five (5) trading day period ending
on the trading day immediately prior to the conversion date, but in no event will the conversion price be lower than $2.00. In
connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the SPA, the Company issued restricted shares of Common Stock
to the two institutional investors in the aggregate amount of 650,000 shares (the “Commitment Shares”). The Company
has agreed to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
of the Notes and Preferred Stock, as well as the Commitment Shares.

 

Upon
the second closing pursuant to the SPA, upon certain conditions being satisfied, the Company will issue one of the institutional
investors referenced above Series A Preferred Stock of the Company (“Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price
of $3,000,000. Dividends shall be payable on the Preferred Stock at a rate of 10% per annum. The Preferred Stock shall be convertible
into Common Stock at a conversion price of $5.28 per share. Upon any conversion, a Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Certificate
of Designation of the Preferred Stock) shall be due with respect to each share of Preferred Stock converted. At any time following
the three (3) month anniversary of the Business Combination, the holder of the Preferred Stock has the right to force the Company
to redeem all or any portion of the Preferred Stock then owned by the holder in cash.

 

Beginning
on the eleventh (11) trading day following the Business Combination, if certain conditions are met, including, but not limited
to, the closing sale price of the Common Stock exceeds $6.00 throughout a certain measuring period, certain equity conditions
are satisfied, the daily average trading volume for the prior five (5) consecutive trading days exceeds of $80,000 per trading
day, and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company’s conversion right are the subject of a then effective registration
statement, the Company shall have the right to require the holder to convert an amount of the purchase price of the Preferred
Stock not to exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate and not to exceed $100,000 during any five (5) consecutive trading days (the “Mandatory
Conversion Amount”) (but in no event more than the lesser of (I) two (2) times the daily average trading volume for the
prior ten (10) consecutive trading days, and (II) all of the Conversion Amount then remaining hereunder), into freely tradeable
shares of Common Stock at the conversion price then in effect.

 

The
Notes and Preferred Stock each contain certain covenants, and events of default and triggering events, respectively, which would
require repayment of the obligations outstanding pursuant to such instruments. The obligations of the Company pursuant to the
Notes and Preferred Stock are secured by all assets of the Company, and are guaranteed by all other entities party to the Business
Combination Agreement.
