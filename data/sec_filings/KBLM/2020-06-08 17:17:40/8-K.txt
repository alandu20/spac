    Item 3.01
    Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 

On
June 2, 2020, KBL Merger Corp. IV (“KBL” or the “Company”) received a written notice (the “Notice”)
from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that it was no longer
in compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the “Rules’).

 

In
the Notice, Nasdaq advised KBL that, pursuant to Rule IM-5101-2, a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”)
must complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of the SPAC’s initial public offering.
Since the Company’s registration statement became effective on June 1, 2017, it was required to complete its initial business
combination by no later than June 1, 2020. Such rule also provides that if the Company does not comply with the above requirement,
Nasdaq will issue a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist the Company’s securities.

 

Accordingly,
Nasdaq has advised KBL that its securities will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market and, unless the Company requests an appeal
of such determination, its securities will be suspended from trading at the opening of business on June 11, 2020 and a Form 25-NSE
will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission removing the Company’s securities from listing and registration
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

  

The
Company is currently in negotiations with a third party to consummate a business combination. Accordingly, the Company plans to
appeal the Staff’s delisting determination by requesting a hearing with a Nasdaq Hearings Panel pursuant to the procedures
set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series.

 

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate a business combination or
that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel will not affirm the Staff’s delisting determination.
