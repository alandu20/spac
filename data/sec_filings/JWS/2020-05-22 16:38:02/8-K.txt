10,533,333 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant (the Private Placement). The net proceeds from the IPO together with certain of the proceeds from the Private Placement, $690,000,000 in the aggregate (the

redeemed in connection with the Companys initial business combination or to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of its Class A ordinary shares, and (c) the redemption of the public shares if the Company has not consummated its business combination within 24 months from the closing of
