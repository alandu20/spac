Item 8.01.
 Other Events. 
On July 2, 2020, Jaws Acquisition Corp. (the Company) announced that the holders of the Companys units (the
Units) may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class A ordinary shares), and warrants included in the Units commencing on July 6, 2020. Each Unit consists of
one Class A ordinary share and one-third of one redeemable warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share. Any Units not separated will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) under the symbol JWS.U. Any underlying Class A ordinary shares and warrants that are separated will trade on the NYSE under the symbols JWS and JWS WS, respectively. No fractional warrants
will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Companys transfer agent, in order to separate the
holders Units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants.  A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the
separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
