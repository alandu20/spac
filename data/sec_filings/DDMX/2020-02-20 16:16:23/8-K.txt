Item 3.03. Material Modification to Rights of Securities
Holders.

 

As previously disclosed,
on August 2, 2019, DD3 Acquisition Corp., formerly a British Virgin Islands company (“DD3”), entered into a Combination
and Stock Purchase Agreement (as amended, the “Agreement”) with Campalier, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican sociedad anónima
de capital variable, Promotora Forteza, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican sociedad anónima de capital variable, Strevo,
S.A. de C.V., a Mexican sociedad anónima de capital variable, Betterware de México, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican
sociedad anónima de capital variable (“Betterware”), BLSM Latino América Servicios, S.A. de C.V.,
a Mexican sociedad anónima de capital variable (“BLSM”), and, solely for the purposes set forth in Article
XI of the Agreement, DD3 Mex Acquisition Corp, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican sociedad anónima de capital variable, pursuant
to which DD3 agreed to merge with and into Betterware (the “Merger”) in a business combination (the “Transaction”)
that will result in Betterware surviving the Merger and BLSM becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Betterware.

 

In connection with
the Transaction, on February 13, 2020, DD3 re-domiciled out of the British Virgin Islands and continued as a company incorporated
in Guadalajara, Jalisco, United Mexican States (“Mexico”), as described in the definitive proxy statement filed by
DD3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 22, 2020, through which DD3 continued its existence as a company incorporated
in Mexico pursuant to Article 2 of the Mexican General Corporations Law (Ley General de Sociedades Mercantiles) (“LGSM”)
as a variable capital corporation (sociedad anónima de capital variable) incorporated in Mexico.

 

The rights of the holders
of DD3’s ordinary shares are now governed by its Mexican bylaws (the “Interim Charter”) and the LGSM. On February
13, 2020, DD3 formalized the Interim Charter before a Mexican public notary, which charter was subsequently filed with the applicable
Public Registry of Commerce of Guadalajara, Jalisco. A copy of the Interim Charter is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report
on Form 8-K.
