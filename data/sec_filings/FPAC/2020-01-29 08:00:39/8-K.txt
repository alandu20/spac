 Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 
The information in this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1 is furnished by Far Point Acquisition Corporation (Far Point or the
Company) and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or otherwise subject to liabilities under that section, and shall not be
deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filing of the Company under Securities Act or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings. 
An Investor Presentation to be provided to analysts and investors with respect to the proposed business combination by Far Point and Global
Blue Group AG (Global Blue) is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report. The Investor Presentation has been posted on the Companys website. 
No Offer or Solicitation  This
communication is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such
offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable Swiss and other European regulations. This communication is not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into, directly or indirectly, any jurisdiction in which
such release, publication or distribution would be unlawful.  Forward-Looking Statements 
This communication includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United
States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. When used herein, the words estimates, projected,
expects, anticipates, forecasts, plans, intends, believes, seeks, may, will, should, future, propose and
variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or
results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside Far Points or Global Blues managements control, that could cause actual results or outcomes
to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors, among others, that may affect actual results or outcomes include: the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the proposed business
combination; the inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination; the ability to meet NYSEs listing standards following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the proposed business
combination; costs related to the proposed business combination; Global Blues ability to execute on its plans; Global Blues estimates of the size of the markets for its solutions; Global Blues ability to identify and integrate
acquisitions; the performance and security of Global Blues services; potential litigation involving Far Point or Global Blue; and general economic and market conditions impacting demand for Global Blues services. Other factors include
the possibility that the transactions contemplated by the proposed business combination do not close, including due to the failure to receive required security holder approvals, or the failure of other closing conditions. Neither Far Point nor
Global Blue undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed
in Far Points reports filed with the SEC and available at the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov.  Additional Information and
Disclaimer  In connection with the business combination, an affiliate of Global Blue intends to file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form F-4 (the Registration Statement), which will include a preliminary proxy statement of Far Point and a prospectus in connection with the business combination. The definitive proxy
statement and other relevant documents will be mailed to stockholders of Far Point as of a record date to be established for voting on the business combination. Stockholders of Far Point and other interested persons are advised to read, when
available, the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus, and amendments thereto, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus in connection with Far Points solicitation of proxies for the special meeting to be held to approve the business
combination because these documents will contain important information about Far Point, Global Blue, and the business combination. Stockholders will also be able to obtain copies of the Registration Statement and the proxy statement/prospectus,
without charge, by directing a request to: Far Point Acquisition Corporation, 18 West 18th Street, New York, NY 10011. These documents, once available, and Far Points annual and other reports and proxy statements filed with the SEC can also be
obtained, without charge, at the SECs internet site (http://www.sec.gov).

 Far Point, Global Blue and their respective directors, executive officers, other members of
management and employees, under SEC rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Far Point in connection with the business combination. Stockholders of Far Point and other interested persons may
obtain more information regarding the names and interests in the proposed business combination of Far Points directors and officers in Far Points filings with the SEC, including Far Points Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on March 29, 2019. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants in the solicitation process will
also be included in the Registration Statement (and will be included in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus) and other relevant documents when they are filed with the SEC.
