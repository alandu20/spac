 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
This Amendment amends the Current Report on Form 8-K of Far Point Acquisition Corporation (the Company or Far Point), filed
with the Securities Exchange Commission (the SEC) on January 16, 2020 (the Original Current Report), in which Far Point reported, among other events, the execution of the Merger Agreement (as defined below). This Amendment is
being filed to attach the Merger Agreement and certain other agreements as exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K, as amended, and to make certain related changes to the description of each such agreement. 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
The Merger Agreement  On
January 16, 2020, Far Point entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, SL Globetrotter, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (Globetrotter and, in its
capacity as a representative of Global Blue (as defined below) and its shareholders as of the date of the Merger Agreement and immediately prior to the closing, the GB Shareholders Representative), Global Blue Group Holding AG, a
stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) incorporated under Swiss law, with its registered office in 38, Zürichstrasse, CH-8306 Brüttisellen, Switzerland (New Global Blue), Global
Blue US Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (US Holdco), Global Blue US Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation (US Merger Sub), Global Blue Holding L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership
(Cayman Holdings), the individuals whose names appear on the signature pages thereof under the heading Management Sellers (the Management Sellers and, together with Globetrotter and Cayman Holdings, the
Seller Parties), Global Blue Group AG, a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) incorporated under Swiss law, with its registered office in 38, Zürichstrasse, CH-8306 Brüttisellen,
Switzerland (Global Blue), Thomas W. Farley, solely in his capacity as the FPAC Shareholders Representative (FPAC Shareholders Representative), solely for purposes of Sections 2.20 and 8.01 thereof, Far Point LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company (Founder), and Jacques Stern, solely in his capacity as the Management Representative (Management Representative). 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties to the Merger Agreement have agreed that, in connection with the Closing (as defined in the
Merger Agreement), (i) the Seller Parties will undertake a series of transactions pursuant to which they will sell, exchange and contribute the ordinary shares of Global Blue for a mix of cash (Cash Consideration) and shares of New
Global Blue (Stock Consideration) and (ii) a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of New Global Blue will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary of New Global Blue (the merger described in clause (ii), the Merger, and together with the transactions described in clause (i), the Business Combination). Pursuant to the Merger each share of the Companys
common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (other than Excluded Shares, as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be exchanged for one share of New Global Blues ordinary shares, and each Company warrant will
convert to a warrant to acquire one New Global Blue ordinary share on the same terms. Upon consummation of the Business Combination, New Global Blue will be a publicly traded foreign private issuer. It intends to apply to list its shares and
warrants on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the trading symbol GB. New Global Blue will be the ultimate parent company of the business currently operated by Global Blue and its subsidiaries. Global Blue is a
leading provider of tax free shopping and payment solutions.  The total consideration payable to the Seller Parties in connection with the
Business Combination is based upon an enterprise value of Global Blue post-transaction of 2.3 billion (subject to adjustments based on indebtedness and other factors as more fully described in the Merger Agreement), a portion of which
will be paid in Cash Consideration and the remainder of which will be paid in Stock Consideration. The Cash Consideration to be paid to the Seller Parties will be approximately $967MM, and will be funded by (i) the $646MM in Company cash held
in trust, (ii) $100MM equity capital committed by certain affiliates of Third Point LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Third Point) (the Third Point PIPE), (iii) $125MM equity capital committed by Antfin (Hong Kong)
Ltd. (Ant Financial Services Group, a member of the Alibaba digital economy) (Ant Financial), and (iv) $125MM equity capital committed by several established strategic equity investors (the investors in (ii), (iii) and
(iv) collectively the PIPE Investors). The Cash Consideration amount is subject to adjustments as more fully described in the Merger Agreement, including a reduction in the event that payments are required to be made by the Company
in connection with the exercise by one or more of the Companys stockholders of their redemption rights with respect to the Companys shares of Class A common stock (Redemptions). The Stock Consideration to be issued to
the Seller Parties will be in the form of common shares of New Global Blue; provided, that, in the event Redemptions exceed 5,000,000, a portion of the Stock Consideration will be in the form convertible preferred shares of New Global Blue. The Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration are subject to customary post-closing adjustments as more fully described in the Merger Agreement. 
   1 









 In addition to the agreement with respect to the Third Point PIPE, an affiliate of Third
Point previously entered into an agreement at the time of the Companys initial public offering to purchase shares of the Companys common stock for $9.50 per share (the Forward Purchase Shares) to the extent Redemptions exceed
20,000,000 shares. In the event such Third Point affiliate is obligated to purchase any Forward Purchase Shares as the result of such Redemptions, Third Points PIPE commitment will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as will the Cash
Consideration (and there will be a corresponding increase in Stock Consideration).  In addition to the Founder Share Surrender Agreement
(as described below), the Merger Agreement provides that in connection with the Business Combination, the Founder will contribute to New Global Blue 2,500,000 shares of Class B common stock of the Company (Class B Shares) held
by the Founder as of immediately prior to the Closing, and that 2,500,000 shares of New Global Blue will be delivered to a nominee that will hold such shares for future delivery to the Founder upon the achievement of certain future New Global Blue
share trading levels.  As a result of the Business Combination, assuming no Redemptions, the existing Company shareholders will hold
approximately 39% of New Global Blue, the Seller Parties will hold approximately 42%, the PIPE Investors will hold approximately 19%.  In
addition, in connection with the Business Combination, Global Blues existing bank debt will be refinanced pursuant to a new bank credit facility. 
Representations and Warranties  The
parties to the Merger Agreement have made representations and warranties that are customary for transactions of this nature, including with respect to, among other things: (i) capitalization; (ii) noncontravention; (iii) compliance with
laws (including with respect to permits and filings); (iv) government contracts; (v) financial statements; (vi) absence of undisclosed liabilities; (vii) litigation; (viii) taxes; (ix) environmental matters; (x) privacy;
(xi) material contracts; (xii) indebtedness; (xiii) anti-bribery and anti-corruption; (xiv) international trade and sanctions; and (xv) customers and suppliers. The representations and warranties of the respective parties to the
Merger Agreement will not survive the closing of the transaction, except in the case of intentional fraud. The parties to the Merger Agreement have put in place a representations and warranty insurance policy with a $100MM coverage limit on
customary terms.  Covenants  The
Merger Agreement includes customary covenants of the parties with respect to operation of their respective businesses prior to consummation of the Business Combination and efforts to satisfy conditions to consummation of the Business Combination.
The Merger Agreement contains additional covenants of the parties, including, among others: (i) covenants providing that the parties use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals, (ii) covenants providing that
the parties cooperate with respect to the proxy statement to be filed in connection with the Business Combination, (iii) covenants providing that the parties shall take further actions as may be necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and

stockholder proposals, and (v) covenants providing that the parties will not solicit, initiate, encourage or continue discussions with respect to any other Business Combination. 
Conditions to the Consummation of the Transaction 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the
Companys stockholders. The Merger Agreement also contains other conditions, including, among others: (i) the consummation of the PIPE Investment (as defined below), (ii) the Company having received concurrently with the consummation of
the Business Combination the proceeds of loans under the Financing Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in an amount which is sufficient to repay all amounts due under the 710,000,000 senior facilities agreement dated July, 26 2012
(as amended and restated on 16 October 2017) between, inter alia, Global Blue Finance S.à r.l., as parent, Global Blue Acquisition B.V., as a borrower, and RBC Europe Limited, as agent and as security agent, (iii) New Global Blue
and certain persons who will be shareholders of New Global Blue after closing having entered into a customary registration rights agreement and (iv) the New Global Blue common stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement having been
approved for listing on the NYSE.

The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (whether before or after the required
Company stockholder vote has been obtained) by written consent of the Company and GB Shareholders Representative and in certain other circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) if the transactions have not been consummated by
August 31, 2020 and the delay in closing beyond such date is not due to the breach of the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate, (ii) a government entity of competent jurisdiction has issued an order or any other action which
would prevent the consummation of the Merger, (iii) the Business Combination and other related proposals are not approved by the Companys stockholders at the duly convened meeting of the Companys stockholders and (iv) if the
