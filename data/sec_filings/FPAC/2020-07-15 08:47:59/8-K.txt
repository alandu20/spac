On July 15, 2020, Far Point Acquisition Corporation (Far Point) issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as
Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.  Forward-Looking Statements 
This communication includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United
States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. When used herein, the words estimates, projected,
expects, anticipates, forecasts, plans, intends, believes, seeks, may, will, should, future, propose and
variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or
results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside Far Points managements control, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially
from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Far Point does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in Far Points reports filed with the SEC and available at the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. 
Additional Information and Disclaimer 
In connection with the business combination, Global Blue Group Holding AG, the intended successor entity in the business combination, has filed
a Registration Statement on Form F-4 (File No. 333-236581) (the Registration Statement), which includes a preliminary prospectus and preliminary proxy statement. After the Registration Statement is declared effective, the definitive
proxy statement and other relevant documents will be mailed to stockholders of Far Point as of July 24, 2020, which is the record date established for voting on the business combination. Stockholders of Far Point and other interested persons are
advised to read the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus included in the Registration Statement, and when available, any amendments thereto, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus in connection with Far Points solicitation of proxies
for the special meeting to be held to approve the business combination because these documents will contain important information about Far Point, Global Blue, and the business combination. Stockholders can also obtain copies of the Registration
Statement and, when available, the proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, by directing a request to: Far Point Acquisition Corporation, 18 West 18th Street, New York, NY 10011. These documents and Far Points annual and other reports filed
