Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 17, 2019, Experience Investment Corp. (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (the IPO) of 27,500,000 units (the Units), including 2,500,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 3,750,000 units. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class A Common Stock), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company ( Warrant ), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $275,000,000.
 
In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Companys Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-233430) for the IPO, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on August 23, 2019 (as amended, the Registration Statement):
 
·                  An Underwriting Agreement, dated September 12, 2019, by and among the Company and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as the representatives of the several underwriters, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
·                  A Warrant Agreement, dated September 12, 2019, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
·                  A Letter Agreement, dated September 12, 2019, by and among the Company, its officers, its directors and the Companys sponsor, Experience Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
·                  An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated September 12, 2019, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC, as trustee, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
·                  A Registration Rights Agreement, dated September 12, 2019, by and among the Company and certain security holders, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
·                  A Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated September 12, 2019 (the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement), by and between the Company and the Sponsor, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.4 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,500,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Companys initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable for cash by the Company so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

A total of $275,000,000, comprised of (a) $269,500,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $9,625,000 of the underwriters deferred discount) and (b) $5,500,000, representing a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee.
