Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
Separate Trading of Units, Class A Common Stock and Warrants
 
As previously reported on Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed on September 18, 2019 and September 23, 2019, Experience Investment Corp. (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (IPO) of an aggregate of 27,500,000 units (the Units), including 2,500,000 Units issued pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 3,750,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class A Common Stock), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (the Warrants), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $275,000,000.
 
On October 30, 2019, the Company issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, announcing that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants comprising the Units commencing on November 1, 2019. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol EXPCU, and the shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants that are separated will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols EXPC and EXPCW, respectively. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of the Units will need to have their brokers contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Companys transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants.
