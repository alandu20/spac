Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
On September 17, 2019, Experience Investment Corp. (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (the IPO) of 27,500,000 units (the Units), including 2,500,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 3,750,000 units. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class A Common Stock), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (Warrant), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $275,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the Private Placement) of an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) to Experience Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,500,000.
 
A total of $275,000,000, comprised of (a) $269,500,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $9,625,000 of the underwriters deferred discount) and (b) $5,500,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account, maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 
Because the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part and purchased 2,500,000 of the total possible 3,750,000 additional units, the Sponsor forfeited 312,500 shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Founder Shares) on September 17, 2019 in order to maintain ownership of 20.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. The Founder Shares forfeited by the Sponsor were cancelled by the Company.
 
An audited balance sheet as of September 17, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
