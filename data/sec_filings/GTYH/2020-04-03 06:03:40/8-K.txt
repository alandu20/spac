Item 5.08. Shareholder Director Nominations.

 

On April 2, 2020, the Board of Directors
of GTY Technology Holdings Inc. (the “Company”) established that the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders (the “2020 Annual Meeting”) will be held on Tuesday, June 23, 2020. The record date for
the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the 2020 Annual Meeting shall be
the close of business on Monday, April 27, 2020.

  

Any stockholder who intends to submit a
proposal regarding a director nomination or who intends to submit a proposal regarding any other matter of business at the 2020
Annual Meeting must deliver a notice of any such nomination or proposal (including any additional information specified in the
Company’s bylaws) to the Corporate Secretary at the Company’s principal executive offices on or before the close of
business on April 13, 2020. The April 13, 2020 deadline will also apply in determining whether notice of a stockholder proposal
is timely for purposes of exercising discretionary voting authority with respect to proxies under Rule 14a-4(c)(1) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

  

To be considered for inclusion in this
year’s proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting, stockholder proposals must be submitted in writing by April 13, 2020,
which the Company has determined is a reasonable time before the Company plans to first mail its proxy materials for the 2020 Annual
Meeting. In addition to complying with this deadline, stockholder proposals intended to be considered for inclusion in the Company’s
proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting must also comply with all applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under
the Exchange Act, including Rule 14a-8.

  

Any stockholder proposal for inclusion
in the Company’s proxy materials, notice of proposed business to be brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting or director nomination
should be sent to GTY Technology Holdings Inc., 1180 North Town Center Drive, Suite 100, Las Vegas, NV 89144, Attention: Chief Operating Officer.
