Item
2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

 

On May 11, 2020, 8i Enterprises Acquisition

to 8i Enterprises Pte Ltd, an entity controlled by the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“Enterprises”).
The Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a business combination by the Company. The Note is convertible into
units consisting of one ordinary share, one redeemable warrant, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an ordinary share
upon the consummation of an initial business combination (which securities have terms equivalent to the terms of the private placement
securities issued in connection with the Company’s initial public offering) at a price of $10.00 per share at the closing
of a business combination. In the event that the company does not close a business combination, the note shall be repaid only
from amounts remaining outside of the trust account, if any.
