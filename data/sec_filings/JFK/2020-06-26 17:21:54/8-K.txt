of future performance and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, assumptions (including assumptions about general economic,
market, industry and operational factors), known or unknown, which could cause the actual results to vary materially from those
indicated or anticipated.

 



      
     
    

 

Such
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (i) risks related to the expected timing and likelihood of completion
of the Business Combination, including the risk that the Business Combination may not close due to one or more closing conditions
to the Business Combination not being satisfied or waived on a timely basis or otherwise; (ii) the occurrence of any event, change
or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Fourth Amended Share Exchange Agreement; (iii) the risk
that there may be a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition
(financial or otherwise), of Diginex or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iv) risks related to disruption of management time
from ongoing business operations due to the proposed Business Combination; (v) the risk that any announcements relating to the
proposed Business Combination could have adverse effects on the market price of JFK’s ordinary shares; (vi) risks related
to the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its effects on the Business Combination; and (vii) other risks
and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the Form F-4, including “Risk Factors” therein, and other factors
identified in JFK’s and Singapore NewCo’s prior and future filings with the SEC, available at www.sec.gov.

 

Should
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate only to the date they were made, and
JFK, Singapore NewCo, Diginex, and their respective subsidiaries undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements

Item
1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement

 

Amended
Share Exchange Agreement

 

On
July 9, 2019, 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp. (“JFK”) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to announce the entry into
a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Diginex Limited, a Hong Kong company (“Diginex”),
the stockholders of Diginex (the “Sellers”) and Pelham Limited, a Hong Kong company, as representative of the Sellers
(the “Representative”).

 

On
October 8, 2019, each of the parties to the Share Exchange Agreement entered into an amendment and joinder to the Share Exchange
Agreement (the “Amendment”) with Digital Innovative Limited, a Singapore public company limited by shares (“Singapore
NewCo”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary DIGITAL INNOVATIVE LIMITED, a British Virgin Islands business company (“BVI
NewCo”), for the purpose of joining both entities as parties to the Share Exchange Agreement and amending the terms of the
Share Exchange Agreement.

 

On
January 28, 2020, each of the parties to the Share Exchange Agreement and Amendment entered into a second amendment to the Share
Exchange Agreement (the “Second Amendment”). The Share Exchange Agreement originally provided that Diginex may consummate
a private placement of its ordinary shares of up to $25 million prior to the date the Business Combination is consummated (the
“Closing Date”). The size of the private placement was increased to $30 million in the Amendment. The purpose of the
Second Amendment is to increase the size of the private placement from $30 million to $50 million.

 

On
May 6, 2020, each of the parties to the Second Amendment entered into a third amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Third
Amendment,” and together with the Share Exchange Agreement, the Amendment and the Second Amendment, the “Third Amended
Share Exchange Agreement”) to, among other things, (a) extend the outside Closing Date of the transactions contemplated
by the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange”) to June 23, 2020, (b) increase the number of ordinary shares
of Singapore NewCo (“Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares”) issuable to the Sellers in the Share Exchange from 20,000,000
to 25,000,000, (c) increase the number of shares the Sellers are entitled to receive if the closing price of the Singapore NewCo
Ordinary Shares satisfy certain thresholds (the “Earnout Shares”) from an aggregate of 5,000,000 to 12,000,000, adjust
closing price targets and to increase the milestone dates by which the Earnout Shares could be issued from three years to four
years after the anniversary of the Closing Date; (d) increase the number of options to purchase Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares
received upon cancellation of the outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares under Diginex’s existing incentive plan
from 4,200,000 to 5,600,000, and (e) allow JFK to issue up to 1,000,000 Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares to third party advisors
or consultants to (i) assist JFK with maintaining funds of at least $15,000,000 in the trust account after giving effect to all
JFK ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account JFK’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the
transactions contemplated by the Third Amended Share Exchange Agreement, or (ii) provide market making services to Diginex after
the Closing.

 



      
     
    

 

The
Third Amendment includes new covenants of the parties prior to the Closing Date, such as (a) JFK shall convert all outstanding
promissory notes issued in favor of 8i Enterprises Pte. Ltd. into JFK private units as of the Closing Date (the “Sponsor
Loan Conversion”), (b) JFK shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Chardan Capital LLC (“Chardan”)
to agree to convert, effective as of the Closing Date, deferred underwriting compensation in the amount of $1,725,000 owed to
Chardan and any additional fees to be paid by JFK to Chardan upon the consummation of the Closing into Singapore NewCo Ordinary
Shares at $10.00 per share, which shares will be subject to a lock-up agreement restricting any transfer thereof for a period
of no less than six months after Closing, (c) Diginex will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its service providers
to enter into a lock-up agreement in connection with receipt of Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares that such service provider will
receive on the Closing Date for a period of no less than six months after the Closing Date, and (d) each of JFK and Diginex will
use best efforts to assist the other party to fulfill the new covenants relating to (i) JFK maintaining $15,000,000 in the trust
account as of the Closing Date after giving effect to JFK’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to taking into account
JFK’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the Third Amended Share Exchange Agreement,
and (ii) Diginex raising at least $15,000,000 through the issuance of new ordinary shares to be completed no later than the Closing
(the “Subsequent Diginex Private Placement”). The failure to comply with the covenants described in clause (d) of
this paragraph will not constitute a material breach of the Third Amended Share Exchange Agreement for the purposes of fulfilling
certain closing conditions of parties, or with respect to the indemnification or termination provisions set forth in the Third
Amended Share Exchange Agreement. In the event the respective covenants that are the subject matter of (d) of this paragraph are
not fulfilled, or, (i) if the market value of the unrestricted publicly held JFK ordinary shares (as calculated under the rules
of The Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”)) that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (after giving
effect to the JFK ordinary share redemptions), and (ii) the combined stockholders equity of JFK and Diginex (after giving effect
to the JFK ordinary share redemptions, the Share Exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby), fail to satisfy NASDAQ listing
requirements ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “Nasdaq Requirements”), the parties have agreed to negotiate in good
faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with respect thereto. However, if they are unable to reach an agreement, such failure
will not be a material breach on the part of any party that elects to terminate the Third Amended Share Exchange Agreement because
the transactions contemplated thereunder did not occur prior to June 23, 2020, the outside closing date.

 

The
Third Amendment includes new covenants of Diginex that (a) without JFK’s prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), Diginex and its affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, or through any other person (including,
its directors, officers and agents) engage with or contact, for the purpose of making an investment into Diginex or any of its
affiliates, any potential investor actually introduced to Diginex or its affiliates by JFK or its affiliates during the period
commencing on April 27, 2020 and ending on the earlier of the Closing Date and termination of the Third Amended Share Exchange
Agreement, and who have not previously (i) had any direct or indirect business or investment relationship with Diginex or its
Affiliates or (ii) engaged in any discussions with or contacted or been contacted by, directly or indirectly, or through any other
person (including, its directors, officers and agents), Diginex or the Diginex’s affiliates, advisors or representatives
regarding a potential business or investment relationship, until the Closing Date, or in the event the Third Amended Shares Exchange
Agreement is terminated, for a period of 12 months after the termination, and (b) without JFK’s prior written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) Diginex will not use any proceeds of the Subsequent Diginex
Private Placement, up to $15,000,000, for any purpose other than its operating expenses and capital expenditures.

 

The
Third Amendment includes new covenants of all parties that, (a) JFK will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its
service providers to enter into a lock-up agreement in connection with receipt of Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares that such service
provider will receive for a period of no less than six months after the Closing Date, (b) JFK will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the balance of the trust account after giving effect to JFK’s ordinary share redemptions, but prior to
taking into account JFK’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the transactions contemplated by the Third Amended
Share Exchange Agreement, to be an amount greater than or equal to $15,000,000, (c) prior to the Closing Date, Diginex will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to raise at least $15,000,000 through the Subsequent Diginex Private Placement, and (d) JFK
and Diginex will use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the Nasdaq Requirements.

 



      
     
    

 

The
Third Amendment includes new conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Share Exchange, such as (i) the balance
of the trust account will be an amount greater than or equal to $15,000,000 after giving effect to JFK’s ordinary share
redemptions, but prior to taking into account JFK’s liabilities for any fees and costs relating to the Share Exchange, and
(ii) during the period commencing on April 24, 2020 and ending on the Closing Date, Diginex will raise at least $15,000,000 through
the Subsequent Diginex Private Placement. As a new condition to Diginex’s obligation to consummate the Share Exchange, JFK
will deliver to Diginex evidence of the Sponsor Loan Conversion. The existing condition to consummate the Share Exchange that
JFK receives executed copies of lock-up agreements from all of the Diginex shareholders has been revised, so that in Diginex’s
sole discretion up to 5,000,000 of the Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares issued in the Subsequent Diginex Private Placement may
be issued without being subject to the restrictions in the lock-up agreement.

 

The
Third Amendment provides Diginex the right, at its sole option, to terminate the Third Amended Share Exchange Agreement if the
Nasdaq Requirements are not met, or if after giving effect to the JFK ordinary share redemptions, the Share Exchange and the transactions
contemplated thereby, JFK fails to comply with the net tangible assets requirements set forth in its Amended and Restated Memorandum
and Articles of Association.

 

On
June 24, 2020, each of the parties to the Third Amendment entered into a fourth amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement (the
“Fourth Amendment,” and together with the Share Exchange Agreement, the Amendment, the Second Amendment and the Third
Amendment, the “Amended Share Exchange Agreement”) to, among other things, (a) extend the outside Closing Date of
the Business Combination to September 28, 2020 and (b) agree to hold the special meeting no later than September 15, 2020.

 

The Fourth Amendment includes
new covenants that all of the parties will, (i) take all steps required to extend the time available to consummate the Business
Combination for an additional three months to September 30, 2020, including, sharing payment of the extension fees payable to
the JFK trust account in the amount of $575,000, (ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill their respective
covenants and closing conditions in order to hold the special meeting no later than September 15, 2020 and hold the closing
of the Business Combination no later than September 28, 2020, and (iii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to have 6,411,100
of the Singapore NewCo Ordinary Shares issuable, in the aggregate, to various parties pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement
be freely tradeable from the day immediately following the Closing Date.


 

The
foregoing description of the Fourth Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and
conditions of the Fourth Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

 

Extension
of time to complete the Business Combination

 

On
June 24, 2020, JFK issued promissory notes in the principal amount of $287,500 each to 8i Enterprises Pte Ltd and Diginex Limited
(the “Funds”). The Funds were deposited into the JFK trust account for the benefit of its public stockholders in order
to extend the period of time JFK has to complete a business combination for three additional months, from July 1, 2020 to September
30, 2020. The notes do not bear interest and are payable five business days after the date JFK completes a business combination.

    1.
    Failure
    to make required payments;

     
     

    2.
