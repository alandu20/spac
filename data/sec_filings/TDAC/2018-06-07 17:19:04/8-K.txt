Item 8.01. Other Events

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K dated June 4, 2018, on June 1, 2018, Trident Acquisitions Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial
public offering (“IPO”) of 17,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock
(“Common Stock”) and one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one share of common stock
at a price of $11.50 per share. The Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,625,000 additional
Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On June 4, 2018, the underwriters exercised the option in full, and the closing of the
issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred on June 5, 2018. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 20,125,000 units
at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $201,250,000. In addition, on June 1, 2018, the Company sold
to Chardan, for $100, an option to purchase up to 1,750,000 units exercisable at $12.00 per unit, commencing on the later of the
consummation of a business combination and six months from the effective date of the Registration Statement.

 

As of June 5, 2018, a total of $205,275,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the private placement consummated simultaneously with the closing of the IPO were deposited
in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders.

 

An audited balance sheet as of June 1,
2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO (not including the proceeds from the sale of the additional
Units) and the private placement is included with this report as Exhibit 99.1.
