Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On May 29, 2018, the registration statement
(File No. 333-223655) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering (“IPO”) of
Trident Acquisitions Corp. (the “Company”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection
therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:

 


·An Underwriting Agreement, dated May 29, 2018, by and between the Company and Chardan Capital
Markets LLC (“Chardan”), as representative of the underwriters;


·A Warrant Agreement, dated May 29, 2018, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;


·Letter Agreements, dated May 29, 2018, by and between the Company and each of the initial
shareholders, officers and directors of the Company;


·An Investment Management Trust Agreement, May 29, 2018, by and between the Company and Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company;


·A Stock Escrow Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2018, by and among the Company, Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company and each of the initial shareholders of the Company; and


·A Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 29, 2018, by and among the Company and the initial
shareholders of the Company.

 

On June 1, 2018, the Company consummated the IPO of 17,500,000
units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Common Stock”) and one warrant (“Warrant”)
entitling its holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price
of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $175,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase
up to 2,625,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On June 4, 2018, the underwriters exercised the option in full.
The closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units is expected to occur on June 5, 2018. In addition, the Company sold
to Chardan, for $100, an option to purchase up to 1,750,000 units exercisable at $12.00 per unit, commencing on the later of the
consummation of a business combination and six months from the effective date of the Registration Statement.

 

As of June 1, 2018, a total of $178,500,000 of the net proceeds
from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the
Company’s public shareholders. An audited balance sheet as of June 1, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation
of the IPO and the Private Placement will be filed within 4 days of the Closing.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the
IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with certain of its initial stockholders of
1,150,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $11,500,000.

 

The Private Units are identical to the
Units (as defined below) sold in the IPO except that the warrants included in the Price Units will be non-redeemable and may be
exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.
Additionally, because the Private Units were issued in a private transaction, the initial purchasers and their permitted transferees
will be allowed to exercise the warrants included in the Private Units for cash even if a registration statement covering the shares
of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered shares of common stock. Additionally,
such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited
circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.
Such Initial Purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the Private Units.

 



     
     
    

 

The Private Units were issued pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
