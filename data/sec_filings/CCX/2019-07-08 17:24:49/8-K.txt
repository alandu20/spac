Item 8.01Other Events.

 

On July 1, 2019, Churchill Capital Corp
II (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 69,000,000 units
(the “Units”), including the issuance of 9,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of
their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001
per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”),
each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share,
subject to adjustment as provided in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, initially filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on June 10, 2019 (File No. 333-232057). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $690,000,000.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO,
the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 15,800,000 warrants (the
“Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s
sponsor, Churchill Sponsor II LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of $15,800,000.
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has
agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30
days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable
by the Company so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.

 

A total of $690,000,000 was placed in a
U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
An audited balance sheet as of July 1, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement
has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
