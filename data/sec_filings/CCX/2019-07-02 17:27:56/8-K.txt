Item 8.01Other Events.

 

On July 1, 2019, Churchill Capital Corp
II (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 69,000,000 units
(the “Units”), including the issuance of 9,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of
their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001
per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”),
each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share,
subject to adjustment as provided in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 10, 2019 (File No. 333-232057). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $690,000,000.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO,
the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 15,800,000 warrants (the
“Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s
sponsor, Churchill Sponsor II LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of $15,800,000.
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has
agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30
days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable
by the Company so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.

 

A total of $690,000,000 was placed
in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the trust account that may be released to the Company to
pay its taxes, the proceeds from the IPO will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of
(i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares
properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of
incorporation to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to provide for the redemption of its public shares in
connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does not complete its
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO (or 27 months from the closing of the IPO if the
Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of the IPO), and (iii) the redemption of all of the Company’s public shares if
it is unable to complete its business combination within 24 months (or 27 months upon the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in (ii)) from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.

 

In connection with the closing of the offering,
the Company entered into an amendment to the underwriting agreement on July 1, 2019 pursuant to which the underwriting discount
will be paid solely with respect to 1,060,000 of the shares sold pursuant to the overallotment option.  As a result, the
deferred portion of the underwriting discount will be $21,371,000 and the Company will have an additional $1,588,000 available
for working capital held outside the trust account.
