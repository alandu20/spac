Item 1.01.
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
September 10, 2019, the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-233449) (the
“Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of New Providence
Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On
September 13, 2019, the Company consummated the IPO of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”). The Company has granted
the underwriters of the IPO a 45-day option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units at the initial public offering price to
cover over-allotments, if any. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the
“Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Public
Warrants”), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock
at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds of $200,000,000. Further, in connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms
of which were previously filed as exhibits of the Registration Statement:

 



     
    ●
    an
    Underwriting Agreement, dated September 10, 2019, between the Company and BTIG, LLC, as representative of the several underwriters,
    which contains customary representations and warranties and indemnification of the underwriters by the Company;

 



     
    ●
    a
    Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated September 10, 2019, between the Company and New Providence Management
    LLC (the “Sponsor”), pursuant to which the Sponsor purchased 5,500,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable
    to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant (the “Private Placement
    Warrants”);

 



     
    ●
    a
    Warrant Agreement, dated September 13, 2019, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant
    agent (the “Warrant Agreement”), which sets forth the expiration and exercise price of and procedure for exercising
    the Warrants; certain adjustment features of the terms of exercise; provisions relating to redemption and cashless exercise
    of the Warrants; certain registration rights of the holders of Warrants; provision for amendments to the Warrant Agreement;
    and indemnification of the warrant agent by the Company under the agreement;

 



     
    ●
    an
    Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated September 13, 2019, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer &
    Trust Company, as trustee, which establishes the trust account that will hold the net proceeds of the IPO proceeds and certain
    of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and sets forth the responsibilities of the trustee; the procedures
    for withdrawal and direction of funds from the trust account; and indemnification of the trustee by the Company under the
    agreement;

 



     
    ●
    a
    Registration and Stockholder Rights Agreement, dated September 13, 2019, between the Company and the Sponsor and certain directors
    of the Company, which provides for customary demand and piggy-back registration rights for the Sponsor, and customary piggy-back
    registration rights for such directors, as well as certain transfer restrictions applicable to the Sponsor with respect to
    the Company’s securities, and, upon consummation of our initial business combination and the right of the Sponsor to
    nominate three individuals for election to the Company’s board of directors;

 



     
    ●
    a
    Letter Agreement, dated September 13, 2019, by and between the Company, the Sponsor and each of the officers and directors
    of the Company, pursuant to which the Sponsor and each officer and director of the Company has agreed to vote any shares of
    Class A Common Stock held by him or her in favor of the Company’s initial business combination; to facilitate the liquidation
    and winding up of the Company if an initial business combination is not consummated within 18 months; to certain transfer
    restrictions with respect to the Company’s securities; and
    to certain indemnification obligations of the Sponsor; and pursuant to which the Company has agreed not to enter into into
    a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of the Sponsor; and

 



     
    ●
    an
    Administrative Services Agreement, dated September 13, 2019, by and between the Company and New Providence Services LLC, pursuant
    to which the New Providence Services LLC has agreed to make available office space and certain administrative and support
    services, as may be required by the Company from time to time, for $10,000 per month until the Company’s initial business
    combination or liquidation.

The
above descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreement, each of which is
incorporated by reference herein and filed herewith as Exhibits 1.1, 10.1, 4.1,  10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5 respectively.

 

Item 3.02.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneous
with the consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale of the Units, the Company consummated the private placement of
5,500,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of
$5,500,000 (the “Private Placement”). The Private Placement Warrants, which were purchased by the Sponsor, are
substantially similar to the Public Warrants, except that if held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, they
(i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption under
certain redemption scenarios and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions
until 30 days following the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination. If the Private Placement
Warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be
redeemable by the Company under all redemption scenarios and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.
The Private Placement Warrants have been issued pursuant to, and are governed by, the Warrant Agreement.

On
September 12, 2019, the Company adopted its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Amended and Restated Certificate
