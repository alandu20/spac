Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On
September 13, 2019, New Providence Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated an initial public offering (the
“IPO”) of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”) at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit and a private
placement with New Providence Management LLC  (the “Sponsor”) of 5,500,000 private placement warrants at a price
of $1.00 per warrant (the “Private Placement”) The net proceeds from the IPO together with certain of the
proceeds from the Private Placement, $200,000,000 in the aggregate (the “Offering Proceeds”), were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of
the Company’s public stockholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal from interest earned on the Offering Proceeds in the trust account to
fund franchise and income taxes payable, or upon the redemption by public stockholders of Class A common stock in connection
with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, none of the funds held in
the trust account will be released until the earlier of the completion of the Company’s initial business combination or
the redemption of 100% of the Class A common stock, included in the Units and issued by the Company in the IPO, if
the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO.

 

On
September 19, 2019, the Company issued an additional 3,000,000 units (the “Over-Allotment Units”) pursuant to
the exercise in full by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in connection with the IPO. The Over-Allotment Units
were priced at $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $30,000,000. Concurrently, the Sponsor also purchased an
additional 600,000 private placement warrants for $600,000. Of the proceeds received from the consummation of the IPO, the
private placement purchases by the Sponsor and the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, $230,000,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in
the public offering) was deposited in the Company’s trust account.
