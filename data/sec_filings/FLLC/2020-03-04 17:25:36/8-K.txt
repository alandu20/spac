Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure
to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 

As
previously disclosed in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 18, 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”), on December 13, 2019, the staff (the “Staff”) of Nasdaq notified Fellazo Inc. (the “Company”)
that the Staff had determined to delist the Company’s units, ordinary shares, warrants and rights (“Securities”)
for its failure to (i) timely file its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019 as required by Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5250(c)(1), and (ii) disclose certain related party transactions as required by Listing Rule 5250(b)(1). Additionally, as
disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 28, 2020 with the SEC, on January 22, 2020, the Company
received another letter from the Staff stating that (a) the Company failed to provide complete responses in connection with an
additional information request pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(a)(1), and (b) the compensation committee of the Company failed
to determine, or recommend to the board for determination, the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive
officers of the Company pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(d)(1)(B), each of which serves as an additional basis for delisting
the Company’s Securities from Nasdaq. As previously disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on
January 8, 2020 with the SEC, the Company appealed the Staff’s delisting determination on December 20, 2019. A hearing was
held on February 6, 2020.

 

On
March 3, 2020, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) stating that the Panel had
affirmed the Staff’s delisting decision and had determined to delist the Company’s Securities from The Nasdaq Stock
Market (“Nasdaq”), and suspension of trading in the Securities would be effective at the open of business on March
5, 2020. 

 

Following
suspension of trading on Nasdaq, the Company’s units, ordinary shares, warrants and rights will trade on the OTC Markets
under the tickers “FLLCU,” “FLLC,” “FLLCW” and “FLLCR,” respectively. Nasdaq will
complete the delisting by filing a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934 on Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission after applicable appeal periods have lapsed.
