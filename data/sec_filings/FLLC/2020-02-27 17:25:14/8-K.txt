(b) Engagement
of New Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

On February
26, 2020, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) of Fellazo Inc. (the “Company”)
appointed Marcum LLP (“Marcum”) as the Company’s new independent registered public accounting firm, effective
February 21, 2020.

For the period
from October 5, 2018 (date of inception) through December 31, 2019 and during the subsequent interim periods through February 21,
2020, except as described below and in the below-referenced filings, neither the Company nor anyone acting on behalf of the Company
had consulted Marcum regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed
or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements, nor did Marcum provide
a written report or oral advice to the Company that Marcum concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching
a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of
a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable
event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

As previously
disclosed in the Company’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on November 15, 2019, December 10, 2019 (as amended on December
26, 2019) and December 18, 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on November 14, 2019, Marcum was engaged as the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, and subsequently resigned on December 4, 2019 because it had not received satisfactory
responses to its inquiries with respect to certain related party transactions, and therefore could not rely on the representations
of management, to conclude its review of the Company’s interim financial statements for the quarterly period ended September
30, 2019 pursuant to AS 4105. Subsequent to Marcum’s resignation, and as further described in the Company’s Current
Report on Form 8-K filed on December 18, 2019, the Company remediated each of the aforementioned transactions. Additionally, the
Audit Committee concluded that the occurrence of such transactions reflected inadequate and ineffective internal controls, resulting
from a lack of proper instruction to the Company’s management and financial personnel or adequate guidelines regarding transactions
between the Company and its sponsor, and between the Company and its management. The Audit Committee has engaged an independent
law firm to further investigate these matters. As part of the Company’s efforts to remediate the aforementioned weaknesses
and to prevent future violations, on February 5, 2020, the Board approved certain changes in the Company’s leadership and
sponsorship, as described in further detail in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 6, 2020.
