    Item 3.01
    Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

As previously
disclosed in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 18, 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
on December 13, 2019, Fellazo Inc. (the “Company”) received a notice (the “Notice”) from the staff (the
“Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that the Staff had determined to (i) deny
the Company’s extension request, and (ii) delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq for its failure to (a) timely
file its Form 10-Q as required by the Rule, and (b) disclose certain information as required by Listing Rule 5250(b)(1). On
December 20, 2019, the Company requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) to appeal the Staff’s
determination, which request automatically stayed the suspension and delisting of the Company’s securities through January
6, 2020. The hearing request was granted on December 24, 2019.

On January 6,
2020, the Panel granted the Company’s request to extend the automatic 15-day stay of suspension from Nasdaq, pending the
hearing scheduled for February 6, 2020 and a final determination regarding the Company’s listing status.

 



    Item 5.02
    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

 

On January 6, 2020, Jonathan Peng Fai Chong
resigned as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Chong’s resignation was for personal reasons and was not due
to any disagreement with the Company.
