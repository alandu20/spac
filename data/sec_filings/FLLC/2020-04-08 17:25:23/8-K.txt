    Item 8.01
    Other Events.

 

On April 7, 2020, the Company
notified Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the “Trustee”), the trustee of the Company’s trust
account established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “Trust
Account”), that the Company intends to dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of
Association and will redeem all of its outstanding ordinary shares that were included in the units issued in its initial public
offering (the “Public Shares”), at a per-share redemption price of approximately $10.14.

  

As of the close of business
on April 17, 2020, the Public Shares will be deemed cancelled and will represent only the right to receive the redemption amount.

 

In
order to provide for the disbursement of funds from the Trust Account, the Company has instructed the trustee of the Trust Account
to take all necessary actions to immediately liquidate the Trust Account. The proceeds of the Trust Account will be held in a non-interest
bearing account while awaiting disbursement to the holders of the Public Shares. Holders of Public Shares may redeem their shares
for their pro rata portion of the proceeds of the Trust Account by delivering their Public Shares to Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent. Beneficial owners of Public Shares held in “street
name,” however, will not need to take any action in order to receive the redemption amount. The redemption of the Public
Shares is expected to be completed by April 17, 2020.

 

The Company’s initial
shareholders have waived their redemption rights with respect to the outstanding ordinary shares issued prior to the Company’s
initial public offering or in a private placement in connection with the closing of the Company’s initial public offering.

 

There
will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants and rights, which will expire
worthless. 

 

On
April 8, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing its decision to liquidate the trust. A copy of the press release is
filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
