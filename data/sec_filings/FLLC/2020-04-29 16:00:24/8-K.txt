    Item 5.02
    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

 

Effective April 27, 2020, Sing Wang, Stephen
Markscheid and Adrian Leung resigned from all positions with Fellazo Inc. (the “Company”). Each of such resignations
were not due to any disagreement with the Company. In connection with Messrs. Wang, Markscheid and Leung’s resignations,
Nicholas Ting Lun Wong, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, was appointed as sole officer and director.

 



As reported on the Company’s Current Report
on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 8, 2020, on April 7, 2020, the Company
notified Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the “Trustee”), the trustee of the Company’s trust account
established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “Trust
Account”), that the Company intended to dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of Association
and would redeem all of its outstanding ordinary shares that were included in the units issued in its initial public offering,
at a per-share redemption price of approximately $10.14. Since such time, the Company has ceased operations and all funds from
the Trust Account have been disbursed.





 

Nicholas Ting Lun Wong, 41, served as the Company’s
Chief Marketing Officer from March 2019 to May 2019 and as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer from May 2019 to February
2020. He had previously served as a director of the Company from inception to February 2020. Mr. Wong is an entrepreneur and serves
as directors of many companies in Malaysia, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, mainland China and Europe. Mr. Wong currently serves as
the director of Shanghai Linxin Food and Beverage Management Ltd. He was a director of Shanghai IRIS Ltd. from November 2018 to
March 2019. Mr. Wong founded and worked for Zenworth Limited and South Pacific Capital Ltd from 2004 to 2006, which focus on the
areas of capital management, private investments in healthcare industry. He also founded Creative IT Pty Ltd and Evolution Enterprise
in 1998 which ventured into the IT and telecommunications sector. Mr. Wong received his bachelor’s degree in management and
marketing from Curtin University, Australia in 2000.

 

As previously reported on the
Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 6, 2020, on January 31, 2020, the Company entered
into an agreement (the “Sponsor Transfer Agreement”) with Swipy Ltd, TKK Capital Holdings, Mr. Wong, Jonathan
Peng Fai Chong, Anderson Heng Hee Toh, Tiong Ming Tan, Chin Yong Tan, Lijun Yu and Ping Zhang, providing for, among other
things, Mr. Wong’s resignation as an officer and director of the Company, along with various other changes to the
Company’s management, board of directors, and the sponsorship. Following the March 3, 2020 determination by the Nasdaq
hearing panel to delist the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Stock Market, the Sponsor Transfer Agreement
terminated automatically, on its terms, and all obligations ceased thereunder. It is expected that following Mr. Wong’s
reappointment, Mr. Wong will oversee the liquidation and dissolution of the Company in accordance with the Company’s
obligations under Cayman Islands law.

 



Other than as described above, there
is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Wong and any other person pursuant to which he has been selected as an officer and
director. There are no family relationships between Mr. Wong and any director, executive officer, or person nominated or chosen
by the Company to become a director or executive officer of the Company. Other than as described above and as reported in the Company’s
Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1 filed with the SEC on February 11, 2020, there are no transactions between the Company
and any directors or officers that are subject to disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
