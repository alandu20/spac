    Item 3.01
    Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 

On
January 22, 2020, Fellazo Inc. (the “Company”) received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Staff
of the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating
that (a) the Company failed to provide complete responses in connection with an additional information request pursuant to Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5250(a)(1), and (b) the compensation committee of the Company failed to determine, or recommend to the board for determination,
the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers of the Company pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5605(d)(1)(B). Pursuant to the Notice, each of the above deficiencies serves as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s
securities from Nasdaq.

 

The
Company originally received a determination from the Staff on December 13, 2019 to delist the Company’s securities for its
failure to (a) timely file its Form 10-Q as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), and (b) disclose certain information as
required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(b)(1).

 

As
reported on the Company’s Report on Form 8-K filed on January 8, 2020, the Company appealed the Staff’s determination
on December 20, 2019 and a hearing has been scheduled for February 6, 2020.
