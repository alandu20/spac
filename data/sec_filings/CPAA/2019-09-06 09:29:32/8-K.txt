Other Events.

On
September 6, 2019, Conyers Park II Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) announced that the holders of the Company’s
units (the “Units”) may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the
“Class A common stock”), and warrants included in the Units commencing on September 9, 2019. Each Unit consists of
one share of Class A common stock and one-fourth of one warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock. Any
Units not separated will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “CPAAU.”
Any underlying shares of Class A common stock and warrants that are separated are expected to trade on Nasdaq under the symbols
“CPAA” and “CPAAW,” respectively. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and
only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the holders’ Units into shares of Class A common
stock and warrants.

A
copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is attached
