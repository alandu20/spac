Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On
July 22, 2019, Conyers Park II Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated an initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 45,000,000 units (the “Units”) at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit and a private placement with Conyers Park
II Sponsor LLC of 7,333,333 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant, generating aggregate net proceeds of $450,000,000
(the “Offering Proceeds”). The Offering Proceeds were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the
Company’s public stockholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee. Except for the withdrawal from interest earned on the trust account to fund up to $1,000,000 of the Company’s
working capital requirements as well as franchise and income taxes payable, or upon the redemption by public stockholders of Class
A common stock in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
none of the funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the completion of the Company’s initial
business combination or the redemption of 100% of the Class A common stock, included in the Units and issued by the Company
in the IPO, if the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of July 22, 2019 reflecting receipt of the Offering Proceeds has been issued by the Company and is included
