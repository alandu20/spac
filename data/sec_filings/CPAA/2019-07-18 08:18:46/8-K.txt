Conyers Park
II Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, priced
its initial public offering of 40,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit on July 17, 2019. The units will be listed on the
NASDAQ Capital Market and trade under the ticker symbol “CPAAU” beginning July 18, 2019. Each unit consists of one
share of Class A common stock of the Company and one-fourth of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Class A common stock of the Company at a price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities comprising the units begin
separate trading, the shares of Class A common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under
the symbols “CPAA” and “CPAAW,” respectively.

 

The
offering is expected to close on July 22, 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.

 

Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are serving as the underwriters for the offering. The Company has granted the underwriters
a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 6,000,000 units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments,
if any.
