Item 8.01.
Other Events.
 

On November 26, 2019, PropTech
Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 17,250,000 units (the “Units”), including 2,250,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’
over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share
(“Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $172,500,000. 

 

On November 26, 2019, simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate
of 5,700,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to HC Proptech Partners I LLC (the “Sponsor”)
at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,700,000.

 

A total of $172,500,000
of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $6,037,500 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and the sale of the
Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance sheet
as of November 26, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
