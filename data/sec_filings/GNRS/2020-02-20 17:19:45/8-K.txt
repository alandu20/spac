Item
3.02.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

The
information provided in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.

 

Item
8.01.  Other Events.

 

On
February 13, 2020, Greenrose Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 15,000,000 of its units (“Units). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common
Stock”), of the Company and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each warrant entitling
the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $150,000,000.

 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of
300,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of Common Stock and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling
the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share (the “Private Placement
Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit and 1,500,000 warrants (“Private Placement
Warrants” and together with the Private Placement Units, the “Private Placement Securities”) at
a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $4,500,000. The Private Placement Securities
were purchased by Imperial Capital, LLC and its designees and the Company’s sponsor, Greenrose Associates LLC. As
further set forth in the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-235724), the Private Placement
Units are identical to the Units and the Private Placement Warrants (including the Private Placement Warrants included
in the Private Placement Units) are identical to
the Warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants are non-redeemable and may be
exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted
transferees. The purchasers of the Private Placement Securities have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the
Private Placement Securities or shares of Common Stock underlying the Private Placement Units and Warrants  and (except
to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business
combination.

 

The
Private Placement Securities were offered and sold in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Private Placement Securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration
under or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer
to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase, the Private Placement Securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful.

 

A
total of $150,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of February 13, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the
consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement
is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 

On
February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 2,250,000 Units that were subject to the underwriters’
over-allotment option at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $22,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale
of additional units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 30,000 Private Units at $10.00 per Private Unit and 150,000
Private Warrants at $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $450,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment
option and sale of additional Private Units and Private Warrants, an aggregate amount of $172,500,000 has been placed in the Company’s
trust account established in connection with the IPO. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation
of the over-allotment is included as Exhibit 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
