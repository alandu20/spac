 Other Events. 
On June 11, 2020, Hudson Executive Investment Corp. (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (IPO) of
41,400,000 units (the Units), including the issuance of 5,400,000 Units as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company,
par value $0.0001 per share (the Class A Common Stock), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a Warrant), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to
purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $414,000,000. 
On June 11, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the Private
Placement) of an aggregate of 10,280,000 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) to HEC Sponsor LLC at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $10,280,000. 
A total of $414,000,000, comprised of $405,720,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $14,490,000 of the underwriters
deferred discount) and $8,280,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as
