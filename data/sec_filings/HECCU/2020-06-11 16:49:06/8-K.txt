41,400,000 (the Units), including the issuance of 5,400,000 Units as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (Warrant), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for
$11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $414,000,000. 
In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the
Companys Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-238583) for the IPO, initially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the

Director entered into the Letter Agreement as well as an indemnity agreement with the Company in the form previously filed as Exhibit 10.5 to the Registration Statement. In addition, in May 2020 and June 2020, HEC Sponsor LLC, the Companys
sponsor, transferred 25,000 shares of Class B common stock of the Company to each of Ms. Schulman and Ms. Duggin, respectively, for the same per-share price initially paid by HEC Sponsor LLC.
 Other than the foregoing, none of the Directors are party to any arrangement or understanding with any person pursuant to which they were
