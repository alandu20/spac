Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
November 20, 2018, FinTech Acquisition Corp. III (the “Company”) consummated the sale of 34,500,000 units (the “Units”)
in its initial public offering (the “IPO”). Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and one half of one warrant (each, a “Warrant”),
where each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold in
the IPO at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit for gross proceeds of $345,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions
and offering expenses). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement (defined below), the Company granted the underwriters in the IPO
(the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional Units solely to cover over-allotments,
if any (the “Over-Allotment Option”); and on November 19, 2018, the Underwriters notified the Company that they were
exercising the Over-Allotment Option in full. Immediately following the consummation of the IPO, there were an aggregate of 44,287,500
shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding.

 

In
connection with the closing of the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed
as exhibits to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-227951) for the IPO, originally filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on October 23, 2018 (as amended, the “Registration
Statement”):

 

●       An
Underwriting Agreement, dated November 15, 2018 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), between the Company and Cantor Fitzgerald
& Co. (“Cantor”) as representative of the Underwriters;

 

●       An
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated November 15, 2018, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company;

 

●       A
Warrant Agreement, dated November 15, 2018, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;

 

●       A
Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 15, 2018, between the Company and certain security holders of the Company;

 

●       A
Letter Agreement, dated November 15, 2018, by and among the Company, its officers and directors and certain of the Company’s
security holders;

 

●       A
Unit Subscription Agreement, dated November 9, 2018, between the Company and FinTech Investor Holdings III, LLC and 3FIII, LLC;

 

●       A
Unit Subscription Agreement, dated November 15, 2018, between the Company and Cantor; and

 

●       An
Administrative Services Agreement, dated November 15, 2018, between the Company and Cohen Sponsor Interests III, LLC.

 

A
description of the material terms of each of these agreements is included in the Registration Statement and incorporated herein
by this reference.

Item
3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the issuance and sale (“Private Placement”) of 930,000 Units
(the “Placement Units”) in a private placement transaction at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating gross
proceeds of $9,300,000. The Placement Units were purchased by Cantor (100,000 Units) and the Company’s sponsors, FinTech
Investor Holdings III, LLC (425,000 Units) and 3FIII, LLC (405,000 Units). The Warrants included in the Placement Units are identical
to the Warrants included in the IPO Units except that, so long as they are held by Cantor, the Sponsor or their permitted transferees
(a) they are not redeemable by the Company, (b) they (including the underlying Common Stock) may not be transferred, assigned
or sold until 30 days after the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, subject to certain limited exceptions,
and (c) they may be exercised on a cashless basis. In addition, for as long as the Placement Warrants are held by Cantor or its
designees, they may not be exercised after November 15, 2023. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect
to such sale. The issuance of the Placement Units was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

The
disclosure set forth under Item 5.03 is incorporated herein by this reference.

 

Item
5.03. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On
November 16, 2018, in connection with the IPO, the Company filed its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Amended
and Restated Certificate”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. A description of the material terms of
the Amended and Restated Certificate is included in the Registration Statement and incorporated herein by this reference. In addition,
a copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by this reference.

 

Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

A
total of $345,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (which includes $14.7 million of the Underwriters’
deferred discount) were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders at JP
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal of interest
to pay taxes (or dissolution expenses if a business combination is not consummated), none of the funds held in the trust account
will be released until the earlier of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend the Amended and Restated Certificate to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s
obligation to redeem 100% of its Common Stock if it does not complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the
completion of the IPO or (iii) the redemption of all shares of Common Stock issued in the IPO if the Company is unable to consummate
an initial business combination within 24 months from the completion of the IPO.
