On May 29, 2020, B. Riley
Principal Merger Corp. II (the “Company”) issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this
Current Report on Form 8-K, announcing that the holders of the Company’s units (the “Units”) may elect to separately
trade the shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and warrants (the
“Warrants”) included in the Units commencing on or about June 3, 2020. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A Common
Stock and one-half of one redeemable Warrant, each whole Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock. Any
Units not separated will continue to trade on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BMRG.U”, and the Class
A Common Stock and Warrants will separately trade on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “BMRG” and “BMRG
WS”, respectively.  No fractional Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants
will trade. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s
transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants.
