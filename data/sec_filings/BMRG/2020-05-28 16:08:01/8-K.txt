On
May 22, 2020, B. Riley Principal Merger Corp. II (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 17,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value
$0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a “Warrant”),
each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share, subject to
adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $175,000,000.

 

On
May 22, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”)
of an aggregate of 650,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) to B. Riley Principal Sponsor Co. II, LLC (the “Sponsor”)
at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,500,000.

 

A
total of $176,750,000, comprised of $171,500,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and $5,250,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the
Private Placement Units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of May 22, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement
has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
