Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

On
March 5, 2019, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering
(the “IPO”) of 30,015,000 units (the “Units”), including 3,915,000 Units issued pursuant
to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock
of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and three-quarters of one redeemable
warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share
of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $300,150,000.

 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 13,581,500 warrants (the “Private
Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor and certain funds and
accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc., generating gross proceeds to the Company of $13,581,500 (the “Private
Placement”).

 

A
total of $303,151,500, comprised of $292,320,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $10,179,000 of the underwriters’
deferred discount) and $10,831,500 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of March 5, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement
