On March 5, 2019, Hennessy
Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 30,015,000 units (the “Units”), including 3,915,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001
per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and three-quarters of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,150,000.

 

In connection with the
IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s
Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-229608) related to the IPO, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “Commission”) on February 11, 2019 (as amended, the “Registration Statement”):

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the
closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an
aggregate of 13,581,500 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private
Placement Warrant to the Sponsor and certain funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (the “Anchor
Investor”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of $13,581,500. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to
the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor have agreed not to transfer,
assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion
of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable by the Company so long
as they are held by the Sponsor, the Anchor Investor or their permitted transferees. No underwriting discounts or commissions were
paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration
contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
