Other Events. 

 

Separate
Trading of Units, Class A Common Stock and Warrants

 

As
previously reported, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of an aggregate of 30,015,000 units (the “Units”) on March 5, 2019. Each Unit consists
of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”),
and three-quarters of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling
the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,150,000.

 

On
April 15, 2019, the Company issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K, announcing that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade shares of the Class A Common Stock and the
Warrants comprising the Units commencing on April 16, 2019. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital
Market under the symbol “HCACU,” and the Class A Common Stock and Warrants that are separated will trade on The
Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “HCAC” and “HCACW,” respectively. No fractional warrants will
be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to instruct their brokers
to contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, to separate their Units into shares
of Class A Common Stock and Warrants.
