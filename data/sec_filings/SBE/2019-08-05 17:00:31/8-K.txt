Item 8.01 Other Events.

 

On July 30, 2019, Switchback Energy Acquisition
Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 30,000,000
units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001
per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company, each whole warrant
entitling the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The
Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000,000.

 

On July 30, 2019, simultaneously with the
consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 5,333,333 warrants
(the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s
sponsor, NGP Switchback, LLC, generating gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $8,000,000.

 

A total of $300,000,000, comprised of $294,040,000
of the proceeds from the IPO, including approximately $10,430,000 of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and $5,960,000
of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, were placed in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. An audited balance sheet as of July 30, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds
upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
