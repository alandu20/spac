Item
8.01 Other Events.

 

On
July 25, 2019, Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting
agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in connection with its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of up to 34,500,000 units (the “Units”), including up to 4,500,000 Units that may be issued if the underwriters’
option to purchase additional Units is exercised in full. Each Unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share
of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”),
and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each such whole warrant, a “Warrant”). Each Warrant
entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The closing of
the IPO occurred on July 30, 2019.

 



On July 29, 2019, the Company completed the private sale of 5,333,333 warrants (the “Private Placement
Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s sponsor, NGP
Switchback, LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $8,000,000. The
Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has
agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until
30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants will also
not be redeemable by the Company for cash and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor
or its permitted transferees.

 

Of
the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, $300,000,000, including $10,430,000 of deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions, has been deposited into a U.S. based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds from the IPO and the
sale of the Private Placement Warrants will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of (a) the completion
of the Company’s initial business combination (including the release of funds to pay any amounts due to any public stockholders
who properly exercise their redemption rights in connection therewith), (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted
in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares
if the Company does not complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (c) the redemption
of the Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete its business combination within 24 months from the closing
of the IPO, subject to applicable law.

connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to
