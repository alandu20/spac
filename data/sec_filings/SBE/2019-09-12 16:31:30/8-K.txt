Item 8.01 Other Events.

As previously reported in the Current Report
on Form 8-K filed by Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) on August 5, 2019 (the “Initial
Form 8-K”), the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 30,000,000 units (the
“Units”) on July 30, 2019. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value
$0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company, each
whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per
share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000,000.

 

In connection with the IPO, the underwriters
were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 4,500,000 Units to cover overallotments, if any. On September 4, 2019, the
underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and, on September 6, 2019, the underwriters purchased 1,411,763 Units
(the “Over-allotment Units”) at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of approximately
$14.1 million.

 

As previously reported in the Initial
Form 8-K, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO on July 30, 2019, the Company completed the private sale (the
“Private Placement”) of 5,333,333 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a
purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Company’s sponsor, NGP Switchback, LLC (the
“Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $8,000,000. On September 6, 2019,
simultaneously with the sale of the Over-allotment Units, the Company completed a private placement with the Sponsor for an
additional 188,235 warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”),
generating gross proceeds of approximately $282,000.

 

Approximately $314.1 million of the net proceeds from the IPO (including the Over-allotment Units) and the private placements with the Sponsor (including
the Additional Private Placement Warrants) has been deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of
the Company’s public stockholders. An audited balance sheet as of July 30, 2019 reflecting receipt of the net proceeds
from the IPO and the Private Placement (excluding the proceeds from the sale of the Over-allotment Units and the
Additional Private Placement Warrants) was previously filed by the Company as an exhibit to the Initial Form 8-K. The
Company’s unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of July 30, 2019, reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale of
the Over-allotment Units and the Additional Private Placement Warrants, is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K.
