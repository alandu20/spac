      On January 9, 2020, CHP Merger Corp. (the “Company”) announced that the holders of the Company’s units (the “Units”) may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the
        “Class A common stock”), and redeemable warrants included in the Units commencing on January 10, 2020. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock. Any
        Units not separated will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “CHPMU.” Any underlying shares of Class A common stock and warrants that are separated are expected to trade on Nasdaq under the symbols “CHPM” and
        “CHPMW,” respectively. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s
        transfer agent, in order to separate the holders’ Units into shares of Class A common stock and warrants.
       
      A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
       
      This report may include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements
        other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our
        management team, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company’s management. Actual results could
        differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All subsequent written or oral forward-looking
        statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including those set
        forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company’s registration statement and prospectus for the Company’s initial public offering filed with the SEC. Copies of such filings are available on the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. The Company undertakes no
        obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required by law.
