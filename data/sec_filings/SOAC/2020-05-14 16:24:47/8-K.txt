Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

On
May 8, 2020, Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated an initial public offering (the
“IPO”) of 30,000,000 units (the “Units”) at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit and a private placement
with Sustainable Opportunities Holdings LLC (the “Sponsor”) of 9,500,000 private placement warrants at a price of
$1.00 per warrant (the “Private Placement”). The net proceeds from the IPO together with certain of the proceeds from
the Private Placement, $300,000,000 in the aggregate (the “Offering Proceeds”), were placed in a trust account established
for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders and the underwriter of the IPO with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal from interest earned on the Offering Proceeds in the trust account
to fund income taxes payable, or upon the redemption by public shareholders of Class A ordinary shares in connection with certain
amendments to the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, none of the funds held in the trust
account will be released until the earlier of the completion of the Company’s initial business combination or the redemption
of 100% of the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units and issued by the Company in the IPO if the Company is unable to
consummate an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of May 8, 2020 reflecting receipt of the Offering Proceeds has been issued by the Company and is included
as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
