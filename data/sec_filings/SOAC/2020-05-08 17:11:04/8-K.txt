Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On May 5, 2020, the Registration Statement
on Form S-1 (File No. 333-237245) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. On May 8, 2020 the Company consummated the IPO of 30,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of
one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable
warrant (the “Public Warrants”), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary
Share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds
of 300,000,000. The Company has granted the underwriter of the IPO a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 4,500,000 Units
at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. Further, in connection with the IPO, the Company entered
into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:


·an Underwriting Agreement, dated May 5, 2020, between the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as underwriter, which
contains customary representations and warranties and indemnification of the underwriter by the Company;


·a Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated May 5, 2020, between the Company and Sustainable Opportunities Holdings
LLC (the “Sponsor”), pursuant to which the Sponsor purchased 9,500,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable
to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant (the “Private Placement Warrants”
and, together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”);


·a Warrant Agreement, dated May 8, 2020, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant
agent (the “Warrant Agreement”), which sets forth the expiration and exercise price of and procedure for exercising
the Warrants; certain adjustment features of the terms of exercise; provisions relating to redemption and cashless exercise of
the Warrants; certain registration rights of the holders of Warrants; provision for amendments to the Warrant Agreement; and indemnification
of the warrant agent by the Company under the agreement;


·an Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated May 8, 2020, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as trustee, which establishes the trust account that will hold the net proceeds of the IPO and certain of the proceeds
of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and sets forth the responsibilities of the trustee; the procedures for withdrawal
and direction of funds from the trust account; and indemnification of the trustee by the Company under the agreement;


·a Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated May 8, 2020, between the Company, the Sponsor and certain equityholders
of the Company, which provides for customary demand and piggy-back registration rights for the Sponsor, and customary piggy-back
registration rights for such other equityholders, as well as certain transfer restrictions applicable to the Sponsor with respect
to the Company’s securities, and, upon consummation of our initial business combination, the right of the Sponsor to nominate
three individuals for election to the Company’s board of directors;


·Letter Agreements, dated May 8, 2020, by and between the Company and the Sponsor and each executive officer and director of
the Company, pursuant to which the Sponsor and each executive officer and director of the Company has agreed to vote any Class
A Ordinary Shares held by him, her or it in favor of the Company's initial business combination; to facilitate the liquidation
and winding up of the Company if an initial business combination is not consummated within 18 months; to certain transfer restrictions
with respect to the Company's securities; to certain indemnification obligations of the Sponsor; and the Company has agreed not
to (i) enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination or (ii) or issue any equity securities of the
Company prior to an initial Business Combination, in each case without the prior consent of the Sponsor; and


·an Administrative Services Agreement, dated May 8, 2020, by and between the Company and the Sponsor, pursuant to which the
Sponsor has agreed to make available office space and certain administrative and support services, as may be required by the Company
from time to time, for $10,000 per month until the Company’s initial business combination or liquidation.

The above descriptions are qualified
in their entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreement, each of which is incorporated by reference herein
and filed herewith as Exhibits 1.1, 10.1, 4.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6, respectively.

Item 3.02.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneous with the consummation of
the IPO and the issuance and sale of the Units, the Company consummated the private placement of 9,500,000 Private Placement Warrants
at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $9,500,000 (the “Private Placement”).
The Private Placement Warrants, which were purchased by the Sponsor, are substantially similar to the Public Warrants, except that
if held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, they (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject
to being called for redemption and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until
30 days following the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination. If the Private Placement Warrants are held
by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company
and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Private Placement Warrants have been issued pursuant to,
and are governed by the Warrant Agreement.


Item 5.03.Amendments to Memorandum and Articles of Association.

 

On May 5, 2020 and in connection with
the IPO, the Company adopted its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. The Amended and Restated Memorandum
