Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On June 24, 2020, Sustainable Opportunities
Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) announced that the holders of the Company’s units (the “Units”)
may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”),
and warrants included in the Units commencing on June 26, 2020. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of
one warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share. Any Units not separated will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”) under the symbol “SOAC.U”. Any underlying Class A ordinary shares and warrants that are separated
will trade on the NYSE under the symbols “SOAC” and “SOAC WS,” respectively. No fractional warrants will
be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the holders’
Units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants.

 

A copy of the press release issued by the
Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
