Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or
Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

 

On May 12, 2020, the
board of directors (the “Board”) of Landcadia Holdings II, Inc. (the “Company”) appointed Scott Kelly to
the Board. Mr. Kelly was appointed to serve as a Class III director with a term expiring at the Company’s third annual meeting
of stockholders.

 

The Board appointed
Mr. Kelly, who was determined to be an “independent director” as defined in the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Capital
Market LLC, to the Board’s Audit Committee. In connection with such appointment, Tilman J. Fertitta resigned as a member
of the Audit Committee. Mr. Fertitta will remain Co-Chairman of the Board.

 

Mr. Kelly, 56, is a
former NASA astronaut and retired United States Navy Captain, U.S. spaceflight record holder and an experienced test pilot having
logged more than 15,000 hours of flight time in more than 40 different aircraft and spacecraft. A former fighter pilot, Mr. Kelly
flew the F-14 Tomcat aboard the aircraft carrier, USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. Mr. Kelly was selected by NASA as an astronaut in 1996.
A veteran of four space flights, he piloted Space Shuttle Discovery to the Hubble space telescope in 1999 and, subsequently, commanded
Space Shuttle Endeavor on a mission to the International Space Station in 2007. His long-duration space flight experience includes
two flights on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, launching and landing from Kazakhstan and two stays aboard the International Space
Station as commander, the first a 159-day mission in 2010-2011 followed by his recorded-breaking 340-day mission to the ISS in
2015. During his yearlong mission, known worldwide as the “Year In Space,” he conducted three spacewalks before returning
home in March 2016. Mr. Kelly has received many awards and honors, including the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of
Merit and Distinguished Flying Cross. Mr. Kelly also was recognized at the 2015 State of the Union Address by United States President
Barack Obama. Mr. Kelly is a Fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and a member of the Association of Space Explorers.
Mr. Kelly was appointed Champion for Space by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. Mr. Kelly previously served on
the Audit Committee of Golden Nugget, a subsidiary of Fertitta Entertainment, Inc. Since his departure from NASA in April 2016,
Mr. Kelly founded Mach 25 LLC, through which he has been active as a motivational speaker and author. In 2016 he published a New
York Times bestseller memoir Endurance and a children’s picture book; more recently, he published Infinite Wonder –
a collection of extraordinary images he photographed aboard ISS, also a New York Times bestseller.

 

On May 12, 2020, the
Company entered into an indemnity agreement (the “Indemnity Agreement”) with Mr. Kelly, pursuant to which the Company
has agreed to provide contractual indemnification, in addition to the indemnification provided in the Company’s Third Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, against liabilities that may arise by reason of their respective service on the Board,
and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against either of them as to which either could be indemnified,
in the form previously filed as Exhibit 10.8 to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-230946) for
its initial public offering, initially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2019 (the “Registration
Statement”).

 

On May 12, 2020, the
Company entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Kelly (the “Letter Agreement”) on substantially the same terms as
the form of letter agreement previously entered into by and between the Company and each of its other directors in connection with
the Company’s initial public offering.

 




     
     
    

 

 

The foregoing descriptions
of the Indemnity Agreement and the Letter Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entireties by reference
to the form of indemnity agreement and the Letter Agreement, copies of which are attached as Exhibit 10.8 to the Registration Statement
and Exhibit 10.1 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

 

There are no arrangements
or understandings between Mr. Kelly and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Kelly was selected as a director of the Company.
There are no family relationships between Mr. Kelly and any of the Company’s other directors or executive officers and Mr.
Kelly does not have any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a)
of Regulation S-K.
