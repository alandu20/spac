    Item 8.01.
    Other Events.

 

On November 22, 2019, Software
Acquisition Group Inc. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 14,950,000 units (the “Units”), including 1,950,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter’s
over-allotment option in full (the “Over-Allotment Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common
stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one half of one redeemable warrant
of the Company (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds
to the Company of $149,500,000. 

 

On November 22, 2019, simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate
of 4,740,000 Warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Software Acquisition Holdings LLC (the “Sponsor”),
generating gross proceeds to the Company of $4,740,000. Each of the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable to purchase one
share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share.

 

A total of $149,500,000
representing the net proceeds from the sale of the Units and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance sheet
as of November 22, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
