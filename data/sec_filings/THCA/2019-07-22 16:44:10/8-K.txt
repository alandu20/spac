    Other Events.





 

On
July 16, 2019, Tuscan Holdings Corp. II (the “Company”) consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 15,000,000 of its units (“Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per
share (“Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each whole
Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000.

 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 215,000
Units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit and 2,150,000 private warrants (“Private
Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $4,300,000, to the Company’s
initial stockholder and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EBC”), the sole book-running manager of the IPO, and its designees.
The Private Units and Private Warrants are identical to the Units and Warrants sold in the IPO, except that the Private Warrants
and the Warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long
as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the Private Units and
Private Warrants have agreed (A) to vote the Common Stock underlying the Private Units (“Private Shares”) in
favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to convert any Private Shares into the right to receive cash from the trust
account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve the Company’s proposed initial business combination or sell any
Private Shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a proposed initial business combination and (C) that such Private
Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated within
the required time period. Additionally, the purchasers of Private Units and Private Warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign
or sell any of the securities purchased in the Private Placement, including the underlying Common Stock and Warrants (except to
certain permitted transferees), for certain periods of time.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of July 16, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the consummation
of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement is included
as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 



On July 19, 2019,
the Company consummated the sale of an additional 2,250,000 Units that were subject to the underwriters’
over-allotment option at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $22,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the
sale of additional units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per
Private Unit and an additional 225,000 Private Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of
$450,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Units and Private Warrants, an
aggregate amount of $172,500,000 has been placed in the Company’s trust account established in connection with the
IPO.
