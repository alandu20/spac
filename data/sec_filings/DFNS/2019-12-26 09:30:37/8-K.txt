Item 3.01
Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 


On
December 20, 2019, LGL Systems Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) received a notice from the Staff of the Listing Qualifications
Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, based upon the Staff’s
determination, the common stock contained in the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering was not in compliance
with the minimum 300 round lot holder requirement as set forth in the initial listing requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5505(a)(3),
or the minimum 300 public holder continued listing requirement, as set forth in the continued listing requirements of Rule 5550(a)(3).
Therefore, the Company’s units will be delisted from Nasdaq unless the Company requests a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings
Panel (the “Panel”) by December 27, 2019.

 

The
Company intends to timely request the aforementioned hearing and appeal Nasdaq’s determination. However, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be successful in its appeal. Pending the decision to be rendered by the Panel, the Company’s
units will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the trading symbol “DFNSU.” The notice received from the Staff of Nasdaq
indicated that while the appeal is pending, Nasdaq will be unable to list the Company’s common stock or warrants if the Company’s
units separated. Accordingly, the Company does not expect to separate the units until after it receives a decision from the Panel.
