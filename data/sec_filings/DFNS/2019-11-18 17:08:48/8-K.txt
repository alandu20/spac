Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities.

 

The
information provided in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.

 

Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

On November 12, 2019
the Company consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”) of 17,250,000 of its units (“Units”),
including 2,250,000 Units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A
Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Class A Common Stock”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The
Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $172,500,000.

 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 5,200,000
Warrants (“Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $5,200,000.
The Private Warrants were purchased by LGL Systems Acquisition Holding Company LLC, the Company’s sponsor and an affiliate
of certain of the Company’s officers and directors. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the IPO, except
that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to
be held by the initial purchaser or its permitted transferees. The purchaser of Private Warrants has agreed not to transfer, assign,
or sell any of the Private Warrants or Class A Common Stock underlying the Private Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees)
until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of November 12, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the consummation of
the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form
8-K. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement is included
as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
