(d)
On February 28, 2020, LGL Systems Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) provided written notice to the Nasdaq Capital
Market (“Nasdaq”) that the Company intends to voluntarily delist the Company’s class A common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, redeemable warrants, each whole warrant exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price
of $11.50 per share, and units, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant, from
Nasdaq effective as of the close of trading on March 12, 2020. The Company expects that the units, Class A common stock and redeemable
warrants will commence trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) on or about March 13, 2020. In addition,
the Company expects separate trading of its Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units to begin trading on the
NYSE on or about March 13, 2020 under the ticker symbols “DFNS” and “DFNS WS.” Prior to March 12, 2020,
the Company’s units will continue to trade on Nasdaq. Following the commencement of separate trading of the Class A common
stock and warrants on the NYSE, the units will continue to be listed on the NYSE.

reference.





 

The

previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 26, 2019, the Company received a delisting letter from The Nasdaq
Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on December 20, 2019. The Company appealed the delisting letter to the Nasdaq Hearings
Panel (“Panel”) and on February 12, 2020, the Panel issued its decision (“Decision”) to grant the Company’s
request for continued listing, based on its finding that the Company has met the requirements for listing on Nasdaq. The Nasdaq
Listing and Hearing Review Council may, on its own motion, determine to review the Decision until March 28, 2020.
