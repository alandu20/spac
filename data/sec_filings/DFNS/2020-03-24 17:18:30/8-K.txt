Separate Trading of Units, Class A Common
Stock and Warrants

On March 24, 2020,
LGL Systems Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1
to this Current Report on Form 8-K, announcing that the holders of units (the “Units”) may now elect to separately
trade the shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants comprising the Units. Those Units not separated will continue to trade
on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “DFNS.U,” and the Class A Common Stock
and Warrants that are separated will trade on the NYSE under the symbols “DFNS” and “DFNS WS,” respectively.
No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of the Units will
need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order
to separate the Units into Class A Common Stock and Warrants. Attached as Exhibit 99.2 is a Broker DWAC request template that can
be used by the broker to request the separation of the Units into Class A Common Stock and Warrants.
