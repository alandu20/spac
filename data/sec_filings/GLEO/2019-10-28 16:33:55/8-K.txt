    Item 8.01.
    Other Events.

 

On October 22, 2019,
Galileo Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 13,800,000 units (the “Units”), including 1,800,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”)
issued upon the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of
the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Ordinary Shares”) and one redeemable warrant of the Company
(“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for $11.50.
The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $138,000,000. 

 

On October 22, 2019,
simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”)
of an aggregate of 4,110,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”), 3,562,000 of which were issued
to Galileo Founders Holdings, L.P. (the “Sponsor”) and 548,000 of which were issued to EarlyBirdCapital,
Inc. (“EBC”) generating aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $4,110,000.

 

A total of $138,000,000,
comprised of the net proceeds from the IPO, sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement
Warrants were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, acting as trustee on October 22, 2019.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of October 22, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO, the Over-allotment Units and the
Private Placement, has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
