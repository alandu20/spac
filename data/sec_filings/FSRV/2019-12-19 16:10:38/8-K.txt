Separate Trading of Units, Class A
Common Stock and Warrants

 

On
December 19, 2019, FinServ Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) announced that, commencing on December 23, 2019,
the holders of units issued in its initial public offering (the “Units”), each consisting of one share of Class
A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one half of one
warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share
of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share, may elect to separately trade shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants included
in the Units. No fractional Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants will trade. The Units
not separated will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “FSRVU.” Shares of Class A Common
Stock and the Warrants are expected to trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “FSRV” and “FSRVW,”
respectively. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the
Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants.
