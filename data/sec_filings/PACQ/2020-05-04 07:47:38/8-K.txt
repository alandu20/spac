Under the Stockholders’ Agreement, the Principal Stockholder Group will be entitled, based on its percentage ownership of the total HighPeak Energy common stock outstanding immediately following the HPK Closing (the “Original Shares”) and provided that the Original Shares constitutes not less than the percentage of the then-outstanding total voting securities of HighPeak Energy set forth below, to nominate a number of directors for appointment to HighPeak Energy’s board of directors (the “HighPeak Energy Board”) as follows:

 



		
			
			 
			
			
			●
			
			
			for so long as (i) the Principal Stockholder Group beneficially owns at least 35% of the Original Shares and (ii) the Original Shares constitutes at least 30% of HighPeak Energy’s then-outstanding voting securities, the Principal Stockholder Group can designate up to four (4) nominees, and if the Principal Stockholder Group beneficially owns 50% or less of the total outstanding voting securities of HighPeak Energy, at least one (1) nominee shall be independent as defined by applicable listing standards;
			
		



 



		
			
			 
			
			
			●
			
			
			for so long as (i) the Principal Stockholder Group beneficially owns less than 35% but at least 25% of the Original Shares and (ii) the Original Shares constitutes at least 25% of HighPeak Energy’s then-outstanding voting securities, the Principal Stockholder Group can designate up to three (3) nominees;

Registration Rights Agreement

 

Concurrently with the HPK Closing, HighPeak Energy will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “HighPeak Registration Rights Agreement”) with the members of the Principal Stockholder Group and the Company’s existing three (3) independent directors, Sylvia K. Barnes, M. Gregory Colvin and Jared S. Sturdivant (such parties being collectively referred to in connection with the Registration Rights Agreement as the “Holders” and, each individually, each a “Holder”)), pursuant to which HighPeak Energy will be obligated, subject to the terms and conditions thereof and in the manner contemplated thereby, to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), all or any portion of the shares of HighPeak Energy common stock that the Holders hold as of the date of the HighPeak Registration Rights Agreement, and that they may acquire thereafter, including upon the conversion, exchange or redemption of any other security therefor (the “Registrable Securities”). HighPeak Energy has agreed to file and cause to become effective a registration statement covering the Registrable Securities held by such Holder making a demand for registration, provided that no fewer than the amount of Registrable Securities representing the lesser of (i) $50 million or (ii) all Registrable Securities owned by such Holder, as applicable, are covered under the Holder’s demand for registration. Under the HighPeak Registration Rights Agreement, the Holders will also have “piggyback” registration rights exercisable at any time that allow them to include the shares of HighPeak Energy common stock that they own in certain registrations initiated by HighPeak Energy. Subject to customary exceptions, Holders will also have the right to request one or more underwritten offerings of Registrable Securities, provided, that, collectively, Holders may not request more than one underwritten offering in any three month period and each such offering include a number of Registrable Securities equal to the lesser of (i) $50 million and (ii) all of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holders as of the date of the request. In the event that the sale of registered securities under a registration statement would require disclosure of certain material non-public information not otherwise required to be disclosed, HighPeak Energy may postpone the effectiveness of the applicable registration statement or require the suspension of sales thereunder. HighPeak Energy may not delay or suspend a registration statement on more than two (2) occasions for more than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days or more than ninety (90) total calendar days, in each case, during any twelve (12) month period.

In connection with its entry into the Business Combination Agreement, the Company also agreed to enter into that certain Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Agreement (the “A&R Forward Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, HPEP I will assign its rights and obligations under the Original Forward Purchase Agreement to one or more third parties, which may include affiliates of HPEP I, the Company will assign its rights and obligations under the Original Forward Purchase Agreement to HighPeak Energy and (ii) the Original Forward Purchase Agreement would be amended to, among other things (a) extend the date by which the HPK Business Combination must be completed to August 21, 2020, (b) permit any affiliates of the Company’s Sponsor who become purchasers under the A&R Forward Purchase Agreement to subsequently terminate the A&R Forward Purchase Agreement upon written notice to HighPeak Energy, (c) provide for the purchasers under the A&R Forward Purchase Agreement to elect to purchase Forward Purchase Units (as defined in the form of A&R Forward Purchase Agreement) thereunder, provided that the number of Forward Purchase Units to be issued and sold thereunder does not exceed the maximum amounts specified therein, (d) permit the purchasers thereunder that are affiliates of the Company’s Sponsor to take certain actions without the consent of any unrelated third party purchasers and (e) expressly state that the purchasers under the A&R Forward Purchase Agreement will have several and not joint liability.

			Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing

In addition, certain of the Company’s shares of Class A common stock and warrants currently trade as units consisting of one share of Class A Common Stock and one-half of one warrant, and are also listed for trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “PACQU.” As a result of the business combination, and pursuant to that certain Warrant Agreement, the Company’s warrants will become warrants of HighPeak Energy and exercisable for shares of HighPeak Energy common stock.

These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Company and HighPeak Energy disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Current Report. The Company and HighPeak Energy caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company and HighPeak Energy, incident to the development, production, gathering and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, low prices for oil and/or natural gas, developments in the global economy as well as the public health crisis related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and resulting significant negative effects to the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets, inflation, increased operating costs, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment, supplies, services and qualified personnel, certificates related to new technologies, geographical concentration of operations, environmental risks, weather risks, security risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production, reductions in cash flow, lack of access to capital, HighPeak Energy’s ability to satisfy future cash obligations, restrictions in existing or future debt agreements, the timing of development expenditures, managing growth and integration of acquisitions, failure to realize expected value creation from property acquisitions, title defects and limited control over non-operated properties.
