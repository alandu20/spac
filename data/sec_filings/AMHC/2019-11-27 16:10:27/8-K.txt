Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On November 22, 2019,
Amplitude Healthcare Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value
$0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“ Warrant
”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share.
The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $100,000,000. The Company also granted
the underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 units.

 

Simultaneously with
the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of
4,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Amplitude Healthcare Holdings LLC (the “Sponsor”)
at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $4,000,000.

 

A total of $100,000,000,
comprised of (a) $98,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $3,500,000 of the underwriters’ deferred
discount) and (b) $2,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of November 22, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been
issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
