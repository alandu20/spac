Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
November 22, 2019, Amplitude Healthcare Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public
offering (the “IPO”) of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share
of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one-half
of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“ Warrant ”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit,
generating gross proceeds to the Company of $100,000,000. The Company has granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to
purchase an additional 1,500,000 units.

 

In
connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to
the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-234324) for the IPO, originally filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on October 25, 2019 (as amended, the “Registration Statement”):

 



     
    ●
    An
    Underwriting Agreement, dated November 19, 2019, by and among the Company and BMO Capital Markets Corp. and SVB Leerink
    LLC as the underwriters, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    A
    Warrant Agreement, dated November 19, 2019, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
    Company, as warrant agent, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    A
    Letter Agreement, dated November 19, 2019, by and among the Company, its officers, its directors and the Company’s
    sponsor, Amplitude Healthcare Holdings LLC (the “Sponsor”), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1
    hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●

Item
3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private
sale of an aggregate of 4,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00
per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $4,000,000. The Private Placement Warrants
are identical to the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign
or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of
the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable for cash by the Company
so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with
respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained
in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 

Item
5.03. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On
November 19, 2019, in connection with the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, effective the same day. The terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
are set forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 

Item
8.01. Other Events.

 



A total of $100,000,000, comprised of (a) $98,000,000
of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $3,500,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and (b) $2,000,000,
representing a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the trust account will
not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination,
(ii) the redemption of any of the Company’s public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend
the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify (1) the substance or timing of its obligation to
allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the Company’s public
shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (2) with respect
to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) the redemption
of the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing
of the IPO, subject to applicable law.
