    Item 8.01.
    Other Events.

 

On September 19, 2019,
Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 35,000,000 units (the “Units”), including 4,500,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’
over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class
A Common Stock”) and one half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $350,000,000. 

 

On September 19, 2019,
simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”)
of an aggregate of 810,000 Units (the “Private Placement Units”), including 657,500 Private Placement Units
to Apex Technology Sponsor LLC and 152,500 Private Placement Units to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $8,100,000.

 

In addition, the 8,768,750
shares of Class B common stock of the Company (the “Founder Shares”) held by the Apex Technology Sponsor LLC
(the “Sponsor”) (prior to the exercise of the over-allotment) included an aggregate of up to 1,143,750 Founder
Shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised
in full. Since the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part, the Sponsor forfeited 18,750 Founder Shares on September
19, 2019. The Founder Shares forfeited by the Sponsor were cancelled by the Company.

 

A total of $350,000,000,
comprised of $341,900,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $13,150,000 of the Underwriters’ deferred discount)
and $8,100,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance sheet
as of September 19, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
