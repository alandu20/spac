The disclosure set forth under Item 8.01 is incorporated herein by this reference.   


Item 8.01
 Other Events 
As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K of Osprey Technology Acquisition Corp. (the
Company), on November 5, 2019, the Company consummated its initial public offering (IPO) of 27,500,000 units (Units), each Unit consisting of one share of the Companys Class A common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (Common Stock) and one half of one redeemable warrant (each, a Warrant) where each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock, pursuant to the registration statement on
Form S-1 (File No. 333-234180). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $275,000,000. The underwriters of the IPO
were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 4,125,000 Units to cover aver-allotments, if any (Over-Allotment Units). The underwriters exercised the option in full and on November 13, 2019 the Company sold 4,125,000
Over-Allotment Units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $41,250,000.  As previously reported on a
Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, on November 5, 2019, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed a private placement (the Private Placement) of an
aggregate of 7,500,000 redeemable warrants (Placement Warrants) to Osprey Sponsor II, LLC (the Sponsor), generating gross proceeds of $7,500,000. On November 13, 2019, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment
Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 825,000 Placement Warrants to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $825,000.  A total
of $316,250,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Units) and the private placements on November 5, 2019 and November 13, 2019 were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of
the Companys public stockholders. An audited balance sheet as of November 5, 2019 reflecting receipt of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement on November 5, 2019, but not the proceeds from the sale of the
Over-Allotment Units nor the private placement on November 13, 2019, had been prepared by the Company and previously filed on a Current Report on Form 8-K on November 12, 2019. The Companys
unaudited pro forma balance sheet reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the private placement on November 13, 2019 is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the sale of the Over-Allotment
Units is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
