Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 

As
previously reported, on May 21, 2019, Big Rock Partners Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) amended its amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to provide that it had until August
22, 2019 (the “Termination Date”) to consummate an
initial business combination, provided that the Company deposit, or
cause to be deposited on its behalf, into its trust account
established in connection with the Company’s initial public
offering $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each extension
period utilized through the Termination Date. The first payment of
$95,604.56 was deposited on May 21, 2019 and the second payment of
$95,604.56 was deposted on June 20, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the
Company deposited an additional $95,604.56, for the third extension
period. The Company now has until August 22, 2019 to consummate an
initial business combination, or such later date as may be approved
by stockholders in an amendment to the Company’s amended and
restated certificate of incorporation. In order to pay for part of
the third extension payment, the Company issued an unsecured
promissory note (the “Note”) in favor of BRAC Lending
Group LLC, a stockholder of the Company and an entity affiliated
with certain officers and directors of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the
representative of the underwriters in the Company’s initial
public offering (the “Lender”), in the original
principal amount of $6,813.68. The Note does not bear interest and
matures upon closing of a business combination by the Company. If
the Company fails to consummate a business combination, the
outstanding debt under the Note will be forgiven, except to the
extent of any funds held outside of the Company's trust account
after paying all other fees and expenses of the
Company.
