Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued
Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 

On
August 9, 2019, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the "Company")
received a notice from the Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq")
advising that the Company no longer meets the requirements for
continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) (the "Rule")
due to the Company's failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public
holders for continued listing. The Company has until September 23,
2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain
compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a
notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no
current effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s
securities on Nasdaq.

 

The
Company intends to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Rule
within the required timeframe. If Nasdaq accepts the
Company’s plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company an extension of
up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notice to evidence
compliance with the Rule. If Nasdaq does not accept the
Company’s plan, the Company will have the opportunity to
appeal the decision in front of a Nasdaq Hearings
Panel.
 



Forward-Looking Statements


 

The Company makes forward-looking statements in
this report within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements relate to
expectations or forecasts for future events. These forward-looking
statements are based on information available to us as of the date
of this report, and involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied
by the forward-looking statements herein due to a variety of
factors, including the Company’s ability to submit a plan of
compliance satisfactory to
Nasdaq, its ability to evidence that it has a minimum of 300 public
holders, and other risks and uncertainties set forth in the
Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update
forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future
events, or developments or otherwise.
