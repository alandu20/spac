Item
3.01. 
Notice
of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or
Standard; Transfer of Listing.



 



On
February 11, 2020, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the
“Company”) received notice from the Listing
Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, based upon the
Company’s non-compliance with the minimum public shareholder
requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as
set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) (the
“Rule”), the Staff had determined to delist the
Company’s common stock from Nasdaq unless the Company timely
requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the
“Panel“). The Company was also notified that as a
result of Nasdaq’s determination to delist the
Company’s common stock, the Company’s warrants and
rights no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5560(a), which
requires the underlying securities of such exercisable securities
to remain listed on Nasdaq, and the Company’s units no longer
comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(b)(1)(A), which requires all
component parts of units to meet the requirements for initial and
continued listing, and the Company’s units, warrants and
rights are now subject to delisting. The Company plans to request a
hearing, which request will automatically stay any further action
by the Staff pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing
process.

 

As
previously disclosed, on August 9, 2019, the Company received
notice from Nasdaq that it did not satisfy the Rule and was
provided with the opportunity to submit a compliance plan for the
Staff’s review. The Staff’s determination follows the
Company’s subsequent submissions to the Staff.

 

Although
the Company is taking steps to evidence compliance with the Rule,
there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the
Company’s request for continued listing, or that the Company
will evidence compliance with the Rule within the period of time
the Panel may grant the Company to do so.
