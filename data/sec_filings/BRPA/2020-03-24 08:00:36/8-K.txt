Item 5.07. 
Submission
of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.


 

On
March 23, 2020, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the
“Company”) held a special meeting of its stockholders
(the “Meeting”). At the
Meeting, the Company’s stockholders considered the following
proposals:
 
1. A proposal to adopt
and approve an amendment to the Company’s amended and
restated certificate of incorporation (the “charter”) to extend the
date that the Company has to consummate a business combination (the
“Extension”) to July 23,
2020 (the “Extended
Date”). The following is a tabulation of the votes
with respect to this proposal, which was approved by the
Company’s stockholders:

In
connection with this vote, the holders of 2,433,721 shares of the
Company’s common stock properly exercised their right to
convert their shares into cash at a conversion price of
approximately $10.71 per share, for an aggregate conversion amount
of $26.1 million.

 

Following the
Meeting, the Company filed the amendment to the charter with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. A copy of the
amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.

 

Upon
filing of the amendment to the charter, the Company deposited into
its trust account established in connection with the
Company’s initial public offering $0.02 for each public share
that was not converted in connection with the Extension, or an
aggregate of $11,610.56, for the first monthly extension period.
The Company now has until April 23, 2020 to consummate an initial
business combination, or determine to deposit additional funds into
the trust account for up to three additional monthly extension
periods.

 

2.           A
proposal to adopt and approve the early winding up of the Company
and redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if the
Company’s board of directors determines at any time prior to
the Extended Date that the Company will be unable to consummate an
initial business combination by the Extended Date. The following is
a tabulation of the votes with respect to this proposal, which was
approved by the Company’s stockholders:
