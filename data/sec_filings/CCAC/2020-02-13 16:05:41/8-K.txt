 Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
On February 13, 2020, CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp. (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (IPO)
of 27,600,000 units (the Units), including the issuance of 3,600,000 Units as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share (the Class A Ordinary Shares), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a Warrant), with each Warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $276,000,000. 
In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the
Companys Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-236006) for the IPO, initially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
Commission) on January 22, 2020, as amended (the Registration Statement):

completed the private sale of 7,520,000 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,520,000. The Private Placement
Warrants are identical to the Warrants included as part of the Units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company,
(ii) may not (including the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of the Companys initial business

pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 








 Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain
Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  On February 10, 2020, in connection with the IPO, Henri Arif was

Class II, consists of Eric Chan and will expire at the Companys second annual meeting of shareholders; and the term of office of the third class of directors, Class III, consists of Mr. Arif and will expire at the Companys

each at a par value of $0.004 per share (founder shares). On February 10, 2020, the Company effected a share capitalization of 1,150,000 shares, resulting in the Sponsor holding 6,037,500 founder shares and Mr. Arif holding
862,500 founder shares.  Other than the foregoing, Mr. Arif is not party to any arrangement or understanding with any person pursuant
to which he was appointed as director, nor is he party to any transactions required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K involving the Company. 
The foregoing descriptions of the Letter Agreement and the form of indemnity agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in

incorporated herein by reference.  Item 8.01. Other Events. 
A total of $276,000,000, comprised of $270,480,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $9,660,000 of the underwriters
deferred discount) and $5,520,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as

public shares) properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Companys Amended Charter (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Companys obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if it
does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial
business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of the Companys public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.
