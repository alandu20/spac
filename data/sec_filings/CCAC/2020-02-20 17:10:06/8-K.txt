 Other Events. 
On February 13, 2020, CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp. (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (IPO)
of 27,600,000 units (the Units), including the issuance of 3,600,000 Units as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share (the Class A Ordinary Shares), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a Warrant), with each Warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $276,000,000. 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of 7,520,000 warrants (the Private Placement
Warrants) to CITIC Capital Acquisition LLC (the Sponsor) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,520,000.
A total of $276,000,000, comprised of $270,480,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $9,660,000 of the underwriters
deferred discount) and $5,520,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as
trustee.  An audited balance sheet as of February 13, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the
Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
