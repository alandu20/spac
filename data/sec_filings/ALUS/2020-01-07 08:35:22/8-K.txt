Separate
Trading of Units, Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants

 

As previously reported,
on Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed on November 29, 2019 and December 5, 2019, Alussa Energy Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”)
consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of an aggregate of 28,750,000 units (the “Units”), including
3,750,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of
one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of
one redeemable warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds to the Company of approximately $287,500,000.

 

On
January 7, 2020, the Company issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K, announcing that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants
comprising the Units commencing on January 10, 2020. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol “ALUS.U,” and the Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants that are separated will trade on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “ALUS” and “ALUS.WS,” respectively. No fractional warrants will
be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of the Units will need to have their brokers
contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into
Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants.
