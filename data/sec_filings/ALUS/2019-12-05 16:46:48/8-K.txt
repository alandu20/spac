Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On November 29, 2019, Alussa
Energy Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 25,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value
$0.0001 per share (“Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The
Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000. The Company has granted
the underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,750,000 additional Units.

 

Simultaneously with the
closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 8,000,000
warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Alussa Energy Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”)
at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,000,000.

 

A total of $250,000,000,
comprised of $245,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $8,750,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount)
and $5,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance sheet
as of November 29, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 

On December 5, 2019, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 3,750,000 Units that were subject to the underwriters’
over-allotment option at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $37,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the
sale of additional Units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 750,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price
of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $750,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment
option and sale of additional Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate amount of $287,500,000 has been placed in the Company’s
trust account established in connection with the IPO.
