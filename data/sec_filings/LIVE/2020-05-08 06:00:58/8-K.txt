Item 1.01.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.


 
On May 4, 2020, Marquis Industries, Inc. (“Marquis”), a subsidiary of Live Ventures Incorporated (the “Company”), entered into a promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) with Bank of America, N.A. that provides for a loan in the amount of $4,767,887 (the “PPP Loan”) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The PPP Loan matures two years from the funding date of the PPP Loan and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. Monthly amortized principal and interest payments are deferred for six months after the date of disbursement. The Promissory Note contains events of default and other provisions customary for a loan of this type. The Paycheck Protection Program provides that the use of PPP Loan amount shall be limited to certain qualifying expenses and may be partially or wholly forgiven in accordance with the requirements set forth in the CARES Act. The Company intends to apply for forgiveness of a portion of the loan in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act to the extent applicable.  No assurance is provided that forgiveness for all or any portion of the PPP Loan will be obtained.  On May 5, 2020, Marquis received the funds from the PPP Loan.

On May 4, 2020, in connection with the PPP Loan, Marquis Affiliated Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company  and Marquis entered into a Ninth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement with BofA (the “Ninth Amendment”).  The Ninth Amendment amends, modifies, restates or supplements the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of July 6, 2015, as amended from time to time, among MAH, Marquis and BofA (the “Senior Credit Facility”) to, among other things, permit the incurrence of the PPP Loan.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the PPP Loan, the Ninth Amendment, and the transactions contemplated thereby are summaries and do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Promissory Note and the Ninth Amendment, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
