Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
 
(a)       On February 20, 2020, Live Ventures Incorporated (the “Company”) received a letter (“Notice”) from The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that because the Company has not yet filed its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2019 (the “Form 10-Q”), it no longer complies for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5250(c)(1) requires a company to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) through the EDGAR system (the “Filing Requirement”). As disclosed by the Company in its Form 12b-25 filed with the Commission on February 18, 2020, the Company has delayed the filing of its Form 10-Q to finalize its financial statements to be filed as part of the Form 10-Q. The Company has not yet filed the Form 10-Q and therefore does not meet the Filing Requirement.  Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company has 60 calendar days, or until April 20, 2020, to regain compliance with the Filing Requirement or submit a plan to do so.  The Notice also provides that, if the Company does not regain compliance with the Filing Requirement by April 20, 2020 and Nasdaq accepts the Company’s compliance plan, the Company may be eligible for additional time to comply with the Filing Requirement.  If the Company does not comply with the Filing Requirement, the Company’s common stock could be subject to delisting.  The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
 
The Company issued a press release on February 24, 2020 disclosing the receipt of the February 20, 2020 letter from Nasdaq and is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
