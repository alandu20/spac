Item 2.03Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

 

The information included in Item 3.02 is incorporated
by reference in this item to the extent required herein.

 


Item 3.02Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

On February 27, 2020, Jeffrey Schwarz, the Chief
Executive Officer of HL Acquisitions Corp. (the “Company”), loaned the Company an aggregate of $175,000 for working
capital purposes. The loans were evidenced by promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $175,000 (the “Notes”).
The Notes are non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation by the Company of a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition,
or other similar business combination, with one or more businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Upon consummation
of a Business Combination, approximately $22,000 of the principal balance of the Notes may be converted, at the holder’s
option, into warrants of the Company at a price of $1.00 per warrant, with the balance of the Notes being payable in cash. The
terms of the warrants will be identical to the warrants issued by the Company in its initial public offering, except the warrants
will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial
holder or its permitted transferees. If a Business Combination is not consummated, the Notes will not be repaid by the Company
and all amounts owed thereunder by the Company will be forgiven except to the extent that the Company has funds available to it
outside of its trust account established in connection with the initial public offering (the “Trust Account”). The
issuance of the Notes was exempt pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 


Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws 

 

The information included in Item 5.07 is incorporated
by reference in this item to the extent required herein.

 


Item 5.07.Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

On March 2, 2020, the Company
held an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders (the “Meeting”). At the Meeting, the Company’s shareholders
considered the following proposals:

1.               
A proposal to approve an extension to the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from March
2, 2020 to July 2, 2020. The following is a tabulation of the votes with respect to this proposal, which was approved by the Company’s
shareholders:



    For
     
    Against
     
    Abstain
     
    Broker Non-Votes

    5,645,041
     
    16,300
     
    0
     
    0

 

In connection with this vote, the holders of 126,000 ordinary shares
of the Company exercised their right to convert their shares into cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.42 per share,
for an aggregate conversion amount of approximately $1.3 million.

 

Following the meeting, the Company deposited
$0.03 for each public share that was not converted in connection with the Extension, or an aggregate of approximately $152,940,
into the Trust Account for the first 30-day extension period. The Company now has until July 2, 2020 to consummate an initial business
combination, or determine to deposit additional funds into the Trust Account for three additional 30-day extension periods.
