Item
1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

Business Combination

 

On June 6, 2020, HL Acquisitions Corp.,
a British Virgin Islands business company (“HL”) entered into a Business Combination Agreement (“Agreement”)
with Fusion Welcome – Fuel, S.A., a public limited company domiciled in Portugal, sociedade anónima (the “Company”),
Dolya Holdco 3 Limited, private limited company domiciled in Ireland (“Parent”), Fusion Fuel Atlantic Limited,
a British Virgin Islands business company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the shareholders
of the Company (“Company Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into
HL (the “Merger”) with HL being the surviving entity of the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, followed immediately by (ii) the acquisition by Parent of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company (the
“Share Exchange”, and together with the Merger, the “Transactions”).

 

The Company focuses on “green”
hydrogen production through the use of concentrated photovoltaic systems. The Company’s two principal lines of business include
the sale, installation, operation, and maintenance of “green” hydrogen generators for clients and the development of
“green” hydrogen plants with a view toward the sale of “green” hydrogen at pre-determined prices through
purchase agreements.

 

The Transactions are expected to be consummated
in the third quarter of 2020, following receipt of the required approval by the HL shareholders and the fulfillment of other conditions.

 

The following summary of the Agreement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Agreement. The Agreement is attached as an exhibit hereto and incorporated
herein by reference.

 

General

 

Consideration

 

Upon consummation of the Merger, (i) each
HL ordinary share outstanding on the closing date will be converted into one Class A ordinary share of Parent (“Class
A Ordinary Shares”), except that holders of HL ordinary shares sold in HL’s initial public offering will be entitled
to elect instead to receive a pro rata portion of HL’s trust account, as provided in HL’s amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association, (ii) each outstanding right of HL will be exchanged for one-tenth of one ordinary share of HL immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger, and each such ordinary share of HL will be converted into one Class A Ordinary Share,
and (iii) each outstanding warrant of HL will remain outstanding and will entitle the holder to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share
at a price of $11.50 per share (“HL Parent Warrant”).

 

Upon consummation of the Share Exchange,
the Company Shareholders will receive their pro rata portion of an aggregate of 2,125,000 Class B ordinary shares of Parent (“Class
B Ordinary Shares”) and warrants (“Parent Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 2,125,000 Class A
Ordinary Shares. The Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares will be identical, except that holders of Class B Ordinary
Shares will have certain protective rights, including the right to approve any liquidation, sale of substantially all assets or
equity, merger, consolidation, or similar transaction of Parent, amendments to Parent’s Memorandum and Articles of Association,
the creation or issuance of any new class or series of capital stock or equity securities convertible into capital stock of Parent,
changes to the size of Parent’s or the Company’s board of directors, and the removal of any member of the Company’s
board of directors. Each Class B Ordinary Share is convertible at any time into one Class A Ordinary Share at the option of the
holder and all outstanding Class B Ordinary Shares will automatically convert into an equal number of Class A Ordinary Shares on
December 31, 2023. The Parent Warrants are identical to the HL Parent Warrants, except that they will not be redeemable by Parent
and may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis at the holder’s option as long as the Parent Warrants are held by Company
Shareholders or their affiliates or permitted transferees.

 




    1
     
    

 

The Company Shareholders also will have
the right to receive their pro rata portion of up to an aggregate of 1,137,000 Class A Ordinary Shares and Parent Warrants to purchase
up to an aggregate of 1,137,000 Class A Ordinary Shares upon the signing of agreements for the production and supply by the Company
or its affiliates of green hydrogen to certain purchasers (or, in the case of the first of such agreements, certain milestones
with respect to performance under the agreement) prior to June 30, 2022. The total number of shares earnable for each such production
agreement will be equal to twenty percent of the net present value of the agreement divided by €10.73, representing the aggregate
agreed value of one Parent Class A Ordinary Share and one Parent Warrant.

 

The Company Shareholders have agreed not
to transfer the Class B Ordinary Shares or Parent Warrants issued in the Share Exchange (or the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable
upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, thereof) except to certain permitted transferees, until one year after the consummation
of the Transactions, or earlier upon the subsequent completion of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, or similar transaction.

 

Webber Research and Advisory provided to
the HL board of directors its preliminary valuation of the business of the Company and its preliminary conclusion that the Company
has a market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in HL’s trust account. Webber Research and Advisory will provide
its final valuation prior to closing.

 

Sponsor Agreement

 

HL Acquisitions Holdings LLC, Metropolitan
Capital Partners V, LLC, the Jeffrey Schwarz Children’s Trust, and, in the discretion of HL, any other persons holding ordinary
shares or warrants of HL (the “Sponsors”) have agreed to enter into an agreement with Parent to forfeit 125,000
ordinary shares and 125,000 warrants of HL upon the consummation of the Transactions.

 

Exchange of Unit Purchase Options

 

EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EBC”)
has agreed to enter into an amendment (“UPO Amendment”) on behalf of itself and the other holders of unit purchase
options of HL issued in HL’s initial public offering to exchange the unit purchase options for 50,000 Class A Ordinary Shares
at the closing of the Transactions.

 

Indemnification

 

The Agreement provides, subject to the limitations
described below, for mutual indemnification by the Company Shareholders and HL for breaches of their respective representations,
warranties and covenants. Claims for indemnification may be asserted once damages exceed a €750,000 threshold and will be
reimbursable for damages in excess of such threshold. Claims for indemnification must be brought before the tenth business day
after Parent files its annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.

 




    2
     
    

 

To provide a source of funds for the Company
Shareholders’ indemnification of HL, 212,500 Class B Ordinary Shares to be issued by Parent in the Share Exchange (the “Escrow
Shares”) will be deposited into escrow with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as escrow agent. To
provide a source of funds for HL’s indemnification of the Company, Parent will reserve for issuance an additional 212,500
Class A Ordinary Shares (the “Indemnification Pool”). Other than with respect to actual fraud, each of HL’s
and the Company’s right to indemnification will be its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for money damages arising
out of or relating to the Agreement. The Escrow Shares will provide the sole source of funds for HL’s indemnification right
and the Indemnification Pool will provide the sole source of funds for the Company’s indemnification right.

 

Registration Rights Agreement

 

Prior to the closing, Parent will enter
into an agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Company Shareholders pursuant to which the Company
Shareholders will be granted certain rights to have registered, in certain circumstances, the resale under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), of the Parent Warrants, Class A Ordinary Shares, and Class A Ordinary Shares
underlying the Parent Warrants to be held by the Company Shareholders, subject to certain conditions set forth therein.

 

Shareholders Agreement

 

Prior to the closing, Parent, the Company
Shareholders, and the Sponsors will enter into an agreement (“Shareholders Agreement”) which provides the Company
Shareholders the right to nominate up to four members of Parent’s board of directors and the Sponsors the right to nominate
up to three members of Parent’s board of directors, each for a period of three years and classified into three separate classes
of directors.

 

Representations and Warranties

 

The Agreement contains representations and
warranties of HL, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and the Company Shareholders relating to, among other things, proper organization
and similar corporate matters; capital structure of each constituent company; the authorization, performance and enforceability
of the Agreement; licenses and permit; taxes; financial information and absence of undisclosed liabilities; holding of leases and
ownership of real property, personal property, and intellectual property; contracts; title to, and condition of, assets; absence
of certain changes; employee matters; compliance with laws; and absence of litigation.

 

 Covenants



 

The Agreement includes customary covenants
of the parties with respect to their respective business operations prior to consummation of the Transactions, confidentiality
and exclusivity, and efforts to satisfy conditions to the consummation of the Transactions.

 

The Agreement also contains additional covenants
of the parties, including, among others, covenants providing for (i) HL, Parent, and the Company to cooperate in the preparation
of a registration statement on Form F-4 (“Registration Statement”) to register the Class A Ordinary Shares and
HL Parent Warrants to be issued in the Merger and to include the proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies from the
holders of HL’s ordinary shares with respect to the approval of the Transactions, (ii) Parent to revise its memorandum and
articles of association to change its name, convert from a private limited company to a public limited company, and incorporate
certain corporate governance practices agreed to by the parties, (iii) Parent to adopt an incentive equity plan, (iv) the Company
to enter into employment agreements with certain key employees, and (v) the Company’s waiver of claims against the trust
fund established in connection with HL’s initial public offering.
