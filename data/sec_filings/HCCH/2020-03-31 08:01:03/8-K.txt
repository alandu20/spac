Item
                                         1.02Termination
                                         of a Material Definitive Agreement

 

On
March 30, 2020, HL Acquisitions Corp. (the “Company”) and Sila Energy Holdings Limited (the “Seller”),
an affiliate of Ajay Khandelwal, a director of the Company, agreed to mutually terminate the previously announced Sale and Purchase
Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2019 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, the Seller and Chi
Energie (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (“Chi”). In connection with the termination, each party released the other from all
claims relating to the Purchase Agreement.

 

The
parties determined to terminate the Purchase Agreement due to the current extraordinary market conditions surrounding the industry
in which Chi is intending to operate and not as a result of any change in the parties’ belief in Chi’s ultimate success.

 

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

This
Current Report on Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements,” including relating to Chi’s ultimate success.
Actual results may differ from the parties’ expectations. You should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions
of future events. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date made. Neither the Company nor Chi undertake or accept any obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
