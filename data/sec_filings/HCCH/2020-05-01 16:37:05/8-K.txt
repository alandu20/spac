Item
1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.



As previously disclosed, in connection with
the approval by the shareholders of HL Acquisitions Corp. (“Company”) to amend the Company’s amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate its initial business combination
(“Business Combination”) from March 2, 2020 to July 2, 2020, the Company agreed to deposit into the trust account established
in connection with its initial public offering (the “Trust Account”) $0.03 for each public share not converted in connection
with such shareholder approval for each monthly period, or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete its initial
Business Combination from March 2, 2020 until July 2, 2020.

 

On March 24, 2020 and April 30, 2020, persons
and entities affiliated with Jeffrey Schwarz, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Jonathan Guss, a director of the
Company, and designees of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, loaned an aggregate of approximately $542,000 to the Company,
including $305,880 representing the aggregate contributions to the Trust Account for the months of April and May 2020. The loans
were evidenced by promissory notes (“Notes”) which are non-interest bearing, non-convertible, and payable upon the
consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated, the Notes will
not be repaid by the Company and all amounts owed thereunder by the Company will be forgiven except to the extent that the Company
has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account.

 

The foregoing summary of the Notes is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the text of the Notes, a form of which is filed as an exhibit hereto and incorporated by reference
herein.
