Item 3.01Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.


 

On February 14, 2020, HL Acquisitions Corp.
(the “Company”) received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”)
stating that the Company is not in compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(3), which requires the Company to maintain at least 300
public holders for continued listing on Nasdaq. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(C), the Company has 45 calendar
days (or until March 30, 2020) to submit a plan to regain compliance with the rule and, if Nasdaq accepts the plan, Nasdaq may
grant the Company up to 180 calendar days from the notice of non-compliance, or until August 12, 2020, to regain compliance. The
Company intends to submit a compliance plan within the specified period. While the plan is pending, the Company’s securities
will continue to trade on Nasdaq.

Statements contained in this Current Report
on Form 8-K that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events
or the Company’s future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because
they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,”
“could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,”
“estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other
similar terms or expressions that concern the Company’s expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Such forward-looking
statements may relate to, among other things, the Company’s continued efforts and ability to regain and maintain compliance
with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Such forward-looking statements do not constitute guarantees of future performance and are subject
to a variety of risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements as
a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise.
