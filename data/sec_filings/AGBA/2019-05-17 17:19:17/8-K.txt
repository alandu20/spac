Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On May 14, 2019, the registration statement
(File No. 333-230804) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering (“IPO”) of
AGBA Acquisition Limited (the “Company”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection
therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:

 


●An
                                         Underwriting Agreement, dated May 14, 2019, by and
                                         between the Company and Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), as representative of the
                                         underwriters;




●A
                                         Warrant Agreement, dated May 14, 2019, by and between the Company and Continental Stock
                                         Transfer & Trust Company;




●A
                                         Rights Agreement, dated May 14, 2019, by and between the Company and Continental Stock
                                         Transfer & Trust Company;




●Letter
                                         Agreements, dated May 14, 2019, by and between the
                                         Company and each of the initial shareholders, officers and directors of the Company;




●An
                                         Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated May 14, 2019,
                                         by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;




●A
                                         Stock Escrow Agreement, dated May 14, 2019, by and among the
                                         Company, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and each of the initial shareholders
                                         of the Company; and




●A
                                         Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 14, 2019, by
                                         and among the Company and the initial shareholders of the Company.

 

On May 16, 2019, the Company consummated
the IPO of 4,600,000 units (the “Units”), which includes the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment
option of 600,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”)
entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive
one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $46,000,000. In addition, the Company sold to Maxim (and/or or its designees),
for $100, an option to purchase up to 276,000 units exercisable at $11.00 per unit pursuant to the Unit Purchase Option agreement
as set forth in Exhibit 4.7, commencing at any time between the first and fifth anniversary of the effective date of the Registration
Statement.

 

As of May 16, 2019, a total of $46,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for
the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. An audited balance sheet as of August 6, 2018 reflecting receipt of the
proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement will be filed within 4 days of the consummation of the IPO.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the
IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with its sponsor of 225,000 units (the “Private
Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,250,000.

 

The Private Units are identical to the
Units (as defined below) sold in the IPO except that the warrants included in the Private Units will be non-redeemable and may
be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted
transferees. Additionally, because the Private Units were issued in a private transaction, the initial purchasers and their permitted
transferees will be allowed to exercise the warrants included in the Private Units for cash even if a registration statement covering
the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered ordinary shares. Additionally,
such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited
circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.
Such Initial Purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private
Units.

 


     
     
    



 

The Private Units were issued pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
