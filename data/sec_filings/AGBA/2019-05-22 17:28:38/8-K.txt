Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K dated May 17, 2019, AGBA Acquisition Limited (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 4,600,000 units (the “Units”), which included the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option
of 600,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”)
entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive
one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $46,000,000. In addition, the Company sold to Maxim Group LLC (and/or or
its designees), for $100, an option to purchase up to 276,000 units exercisable at $11.50 per unit, commencing at any time between
the first and fifth anniversary of the effective date of the Registration Statement.

 

As of May 16, 2019, a total of $46,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the private placement consummated simultaneously with the closing of the IPO were deposited
in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.

2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the private placement is included with this report as
