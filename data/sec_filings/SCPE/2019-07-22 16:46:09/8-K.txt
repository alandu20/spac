            On July 16, 2019, SC Health Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Company”), consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
              of 15,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”),






              with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $150,000,000.
             
              
            Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 5,000,000 warrants (the “Private






                Placement Warrants”) to the Company’s sponsor, SC Health Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company, at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,000,000.
             
              
            A total of $150,000,000, comprised of $147,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $5,250,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount)
              and $3,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a segregated U.S.-based trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting
              as trustee.

              the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
