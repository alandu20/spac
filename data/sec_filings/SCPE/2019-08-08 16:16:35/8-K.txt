        As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K of SC Health Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the
          “Company”), on July 22, 2019, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 15,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share ( “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and
          one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per
          share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $150,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”)
          a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On August 2, 2019, the Underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and purchased an additional 2,250,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”), generating gross proceeds of $22,500,000.
        
        
        As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company
          completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants (the “Private
              Placement Warrants”) to SC Health Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Sponsor”), at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement
          Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,000,000. In connection with the Underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 450,000 Private Placement Warrants, generating gross proceeds
          to the Company of $450,000.
        
        
        A total of $22,837,500, comprised of $22,050,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $787,500 of the Underwriters’
          deferred discount) and $450,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC,
          acting as trustee.
        
        
        An audited balance sheet as of July 16, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private
          Placement has been issued by the Company and previously filed as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K on July 22, 2019. The Company’s unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of July 16, 2019, adjusted for the closing of the sale of the
          Over-Allotment Units and the Private Placement on August 2, 2019 is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
