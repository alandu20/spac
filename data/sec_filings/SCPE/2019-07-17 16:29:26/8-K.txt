    Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
    
    
    On July 16, 2019, SC Health Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Company”), consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 15,000,000
      units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”). Each whole
      Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $150,000,000.
    
    
    In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s Registration Statement on

    Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
    
    
    Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated July 11, 2019, previously filed as Exhibit 10.4 to the
      Registration Statement, the Company completed the private sale of 5,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of
      $5,000,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted
      transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable by the Company so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. No underwriting
      discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
    
      
        
    
    
    
    Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
    
    
    On July 11, 2019, in connection with the IPO, Angelo John Coloma (the Company’s Chief Executive Officer), Dr. Lim Cheok Peng, Frank Lavin and Suresh
      Marimuthu (the “New Directors” and, together with David Sin, the “Directors”) were appointed to the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”). Effective July 11, 2019, each of Dr. Lim Cheok Peng, Mr. Lavin and Mr. Marimuthu
      was also appointed to the Board’s Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with Mr. Marimuthu serving as chair of the Audit Committee,  Dr. Lim serving as chair of the Compensation Committee and Mr.
      Lavin serving as chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
    
    
    Following the appointment of the New Directors, the Board is comprised of the three classes. The term of office of the first class of directors,
      consisting of Mr. Coloma, will expire at the Company’s first annual meeting of shareholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Mr. Sin and Mr. Lavin, will expire at the Company’s second annual meeting of shareholders.
      The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Dr. Lim and Mr. Marimuthu, will expire at the Company’s third annual meeting of shareholders.
    
    
    In July 2019, the Sponsor transferred 25,000 of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares to each of Dr. Lim Cheok Peng, Mr. Lavin and Mr. Marimuthu. The
      Company will reimburse the Directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with fulfilling their roles as directors.
    
    
    Other than the foregoing, none of the Directors are party to any arrangement or understanding with any person pursuant to which they were appointed as
      directors, nor are they party to any transactions required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K involving the Company.
    
    
    Item 8.01. Other Events.
    
    
    A total of $150,000,000, comprised of the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, including $5,250,000 of the underwriters’
      deferred discount, was placed in a U.S.-based trust at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by AST, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to
      pay its taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of: (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any of the Company’s public shares
      properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if it
      does not complete its initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to the rights of the Class A Ordinary Shares; and (iii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares
      if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.
    
    
    On July 11, 2019, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of the IPO, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
      Report on Form 8-K.
    
    
    As previously disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement with SC Health Group, for the purchase of
      5,000,000 Class A Ordinary Shares, plus an aggregate of 1,250,000 redeemable warrants to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share at $11.50 per share (“Forward Purchase Warrants”), for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000,000, or $10.00 per Class
      A Ordinary Share, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of its initial business combination.
