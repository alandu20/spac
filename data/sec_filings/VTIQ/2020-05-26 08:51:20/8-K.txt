with the SEC, which includes the proxy statement/prospectus/information statement dated May 8, 2020 (the “Proxy

proxies for the vote by VectoIQ’s stockholders with respect to the Proposed Transactions and other matters as described
in the Registration Statement, a prospectus relating to the offer of the securities to be issued to Nikola’s
stockholders in connection with the Proposed Transactions, and an information statement to Nikola’s stockholders
regarding the Proposed Transactions. Investors and security holders and other interested parties are urged to read the Proxy
Statement, and any amendments thereto and any other documents filed with the SEC when they become available, carefully and in
their entirety because they contain important information about VectoIQ, Nikola and the Proposed Transactions. Investors and

and other interested persons should read the Registration Statement carefully before making any voting or investment decisions.
These documents can be obtained free of charge from the sources indicated above.
