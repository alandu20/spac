Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

 

General

 

On March 2, 2020,
VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“VectoIQ”), VCTIQ Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation
(“Merger Sub”), and Nikola Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into
a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which VectoIQ and the Company
will enter into a business combination. The terms of the Business Combination Agreement, which contains customary representations
and warranties, covenants, closing conditions, termination fee provisions and other terms relating to the Merger (defined below)
and the other transactions contemplated thereby, are summarized below. Capitalized terms used in this Current Report on Form 8-K
but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Business Combination Agreement.

 

The Business Combination Agreement

 

Structure of the
Transaction

 

The transaction is
structured as a reverse triangular merger, which includes the following:

 


(a)Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub, a newly formed,
wholly-owned direct subsidiary of VectoIQ, will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger,” together
with the other transactions related thereto, the “Proposed Transactions”), with the Company surviving the Merger
as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of VectoIQ (the “Surviving Corporation”);

 


(b)Contemporaneously with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, certain investors have
entered into certain subscription agreements, pursuant to which such investors will purchase shares of VectoIQ Common Stock at
a purchase price of $10.00 per share in a private placement to be consummated immediately prior to the consummation of the Proposed
Transactions;

 


(c)In addition, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, VectoIQ, the
Company and the Key Company Stockholders entered into a Stockholder Support Agreement, pursuant to which such Key Company Stockholders
agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in favor of the Business Combination
Agreement and the Proposed Transactions; and

 


(d)In connection with the Closing, VectoIQ, certain stockholders of the Company and certain stockholders
of VectoIQ will also enter into a registration rights and lock-up agreement (the “Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement”).

 

Conversion of Securities

 

Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the Company will cause each share of Company Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time to be automatically converted into a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each converted share of
Company Preferred Stock will no longer be outstanding and will cease to exist, such that each holder of Company Preferred Stock
will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities.

 

At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of VectoIQ, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the Company’s
securities:

 


(a)All shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the number of shares of VectoIQ Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
(the “Per Share Merger Consideration”);

 




     2 
     
    

 


(b)All shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held in the treasury of the Company
will be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect thereto;

 


(c)Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation; and

 


(d)Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested
or unvested, will be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of VectoIQ Common Stock (such option, an “Exchanged
Option”) equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise
price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided in the Business Combination Agreement,
following the Effective Time, each Exchanged Option will continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting
and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

Proxy Statement

 

As promptly as practicable,
after the date of the Business Combination Agreement and receipt of the PCAOB Audited Financials, (a) VectoIQ and the Company
will prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a proxy statement/information
statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Proxy/Information Statement”) to be sent to the
Company Stockholders and the VectoIQ Stockholders relating to (i) with respect to the Company Stockholders, the action to
be taken by certain stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Written Consent and (ii) with respect to the VectoIQ Stockholders,
the VectoIQ Stockholders’ Meeting to be held to consider approval and adoption of (A) the Business Combination Agreement
and the Merger, (B) the issuance of VectoIQ Common Stock as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, (C) the
second amended and restated certificate of incorporation of VectoIQ and (D) any other proposals the parties deem necessary
to effectuate the Merger (collectively, the “VectoIQ Proposals”) and (b) VectoIQ will prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4, in which the Proxy/Information Statement will be included as a prospectus,
in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), of
shares of VectoIQ Common Stock to be issued to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement.

 

Stock Exchange Listing

 

VectoIQ will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of VectoIQ Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Proposed Transactions to
be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market at Closing. Until the Closing, VectoIQ shall use its reasonable best efforts
to keep the VectoIQ Common Stock and VectoIQ Warrants listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

 

Closing, Extension

 

The Closing will occur
as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than three Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing
conditions. If, by May 1, 2020, VectoIQ and the Company determine that that the Closing is unlikely to be consummated on or
before May 18, 2020 (the “First Expiration Date”), then VectoIQ shall take all actions necessary to obtain
the approval of the VectoIQ Stockholders to extend the deadline for VectoIQ to consummate its initial business combination (the
 “Extension”) to a date after the First Expiration Date but prior to August 31, 2020 (the “Outside
Date”) in accordance with the VectoIQ Organizational Documents. VectoIQ shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
stockholder approval for any and all required Extensions during the term of the Business Combination Agreement.

VectoIQ within twenty-four hours after the Registration Statement becomes effective; or (iii) there is an occurrence of a

A copy of the Business
Combination Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The foregoing description of the Business Combination Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
Business Combination Agreement filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Business Combination Agreement is included
to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual
information about VectoIQ, the Company or the other parties thereto. In particular, the assertions embodied in representations
and warranties by VectoIQ, the Company and Merger Sub contained in the Business Combination Agreement are qualified by information
in the disclosure schedules provided by the parties in connection with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement. These
disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties
set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Business Combination Agreement
were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, investors
and security holders should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Business Combination Agreement as characterizations
of the actual state of facts about VectoIQ, the Company or Merger Sub.

Stockholder Support Agreement

 

On March 2, 2020,
the Key Company Stockholders entered into the Stockholder Support Agreement (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”)
pursuant to which such Key Company Stockholders agreed to vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the Proposed Transactions. Additionally, such Key Company Stockholders have agreed
not to (a) transfer any of their shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (or enter into any arrangement
with respect thereto) or (b) enter into any voting arrangement that is inconsistent with the Stockholder Support Agreement.

 

The foregoing description of the Stockholder
Support Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stockholder Support Agreement, a copy of which
is included as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.

 

Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement

 

In connection with
the Proposed Transactions, VectoIQ, certain persons and entities holding founder shares and private units of VectoIQ (the “Original
Holders”) and certain stockholders of the Company (the “New Holders” and, collectively with the Original
Holders, the “Holders”) will enter into the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement at the Closing. Pursuant
to the terms of the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, VectoIQ will be obligated to file a registration statement to register
the resale of certain securities of VectoIQ held by the Holders. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights
and Lock-Up Agreement and subject to certain requirements and customary conditions, including with regard to the number of demand
rights that may be exercised, the Holders may demand at any time or from time to time, that VectoIQ file a registration statement
on Form S-3 (or on Form S-1 if Form S-3 is not available) to register the securities of VectoIQ held by such Holders.
The Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement will also provide the Holders with “piggy-back” registration rights,
subject to certain requirements and customary conditions.

 

The Registration Rights
and Lock-Up Agreement further provides for the securities of VectoIQ held by the Holders to be locked-up for a period of time following
the Closing, as described below, subject to certain exceptions. The securities held by the Original Holders will be locked-up for
one year following the Closing, subject to earlier release if (i) the reported last sale price of VectoIQ’s common stock
equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like)
for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Closing or (ii) if VectoIQ
consummates a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction after the Cloisng which results in all of VectoIQ’s
stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. The securities held
by the New Holders, other than certain entities controlled by Trevor Milton, will be locked-up for 180 days after the Closing.
The securities held by certain entities controlled by Trevor Milton will be locked up for one year following the Closing, except
that they would be permitted to sell or otherwise transfer an aggregate of $70.0 million shares of VectoIQ Common Stock commencing
180 days after the Closing.

 

The foregoing description
of the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Registration
Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, a copy of which is included as Exhibit A to the Business Combination Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.1
to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.

 

Subscription Agreements

 

In connection with
the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, effective as of March 2, 2020, VectoIQ entered into separate subscription
agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) with a number of investors (each a “Subscriber”),
pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed to purchase, and VectoIQ agreed to sell to the Subscribers, an aggregate of 52,500,000
shares of VectoIQ Common Stock (the “PIPE Shares”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate
purchase price of $525 million, in a private placement (the “PIPE”).

 




     8 
     
    

 

The closing of the
sale of the PIPE Shares pursuant to the Subscription Agreement is contingent upon, among other customary closing conditions, the
substantially concurrent consummation of the Proposed Transactions. The purpose of the PIPE is to raise additional capital for
use by the combined company following the Closing.

 

Pursuant to the Subscription
Agreements, VectoIQ agreed that, within 45 calendar days after the consummation of the Proposed Transactions (the “Filing
Deadline”), VectoIQ will file with the SEC (at VectoIQ’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering
the resale of the PIPE Shares (the “Resale Registration Statement”), and VectoIQ shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Resale Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof.
Under certain circumstances, additional payments by VectoIQ may be assessed with respect to the PIPE Shares in the event that (i) the
Resale Registration Statement has not been filed with the SEC by the Filing Deadline; (ii) the Resale Registration Statement
has not been declared effective by the SEC by 60 days (or 120 days if the SEC notifies VectoIQ that it will review the Resale Registration
Statement) following the Filing Deadline; (iii) the Resale Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC but thereafter
ceases to be effective prior to the expiration of a designated effective period or a Subscriber is not permitted to utilize the
Resale Registration Statement to resell the PIPE Shares; or (iv) under certain circumstances, VectoIQ fails to file with the
Commission any required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), such that the Subscribers who are not affiliates of VectoIQ are unable to sell their PIPE Shares without restriction
under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The additional payments by VectoIQ shall accrue on the applicable registrable securities
at a rate of 0.5% of the aggregate purchase price paid for such registrable securities per month, subject to certain terms and
limitations (including a cap of 5.0% of the aggregate purchase price).

 

The foregoing description
of the Subscription Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the Subscription Agreement,
a copy of which is included as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

The disclosure set
forth above in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein. The securities of VectoIQ
that may be issued in connection with the Subscription Agreements will not be registered under the Securities Act in reliance on
the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.

 

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

 

On March 3, 2020,
VectoIQ and the Company issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Business Combination Agreement and announcing

Important Information and Where to Find
It

 

In connection with
the Proposed Transactions, VectoIQ intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4, including a proxy statement/prospectus/information
statement (the “Registration Statement”), with the SEC, which will include a preliminary proxy statement to
be distributed to holders of VectoIQ’s common stock in connection with VectoIQ’s solicitation of proxies for the vote
by VectoIQ’s stockholders with respect to the Proposed Transactions and other matters as described in the Registration Statement,
a prospectus relating to the offer of the securities to be issued to the Company’s stockholders in connection with the Proposed
Transactions, and an information statement to Company’s stockholders regarding the Proposed Transactions. After the Registration
Statement has been filed and declared effective, VectoIQ will mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus, when available, to
its stockholders. Investors and security holders and other interested parties are urged to read the proxy statement/prospectus,
any amendments thereto and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully and in their entirety when they become available because
they will contain important information about VectoIQ, the Company and the Proposed Transactions. Investors and security holders

and other documents filed with the SEC by VectoIQ through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov, or by directing
a request to: VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., 1354 Flagler Drive, Mamaroneck, NY 10543.

and their respective directors and certain of their respective executive officers and other members of management and employees

directors and executive officers of VectoIQ is set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2018. Additional information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation and a description of their direct and indirect
interests, by security holdings or otherwise, will be included in the Registration Statement and other relevant materials to be
filed with the SEC regarding the Proposed Transactions when they become available. Stockholders, potential investors and other
interested persons should read the Registration Statement carefully when it becomes available before making any voting or investment
decisions. When available, these documents can be obtained free of charge from the sources indicated above.

Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Current Report
on Form 8-K includes certain statements that are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the
safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally
are accompanied by words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,”
 “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “plan,”
 “predict,” “potential,” “seem,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,”
and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of revenue and other financial
and performance metrics and projections of market opportunity and expectations, VectoIQ’s ability to enter into definitive
agreements or consummate a transaction with the Company; VectoIQ’s ability to obtain the financing necessary consummate the
Proposed Transactions; and the expected timing of completion of the Proposed Transactions. These statements are based on various
assumptions and on the current expectations of VectoIQ’s and the Company’s management and are not predictions of actual
performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and
must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability.
Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and
circumstances are beyond the control of VectoIQ and the Company. These forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks
and uncertainties, including general economic, financial, legal, political and business conditions and changes in domestic and
foreign markets; the outcome of judicial proceedings to which the Company is, or may become a party; the inability of the parties
to enter into definitive agreements or successfully or timely consummate the Proposed Transactions or to satisfy the other conditions
to the closing of the Proposed Transactions, including the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed
or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the combined company; the risk that the approval of the
stockholders of VectoIQ for the Proposed Transactions is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Proposed
Transactions, including as a result of a delay in consummating the Proposed Transaction or difficulty in, or costs associated with,
integrating the businesses of VectoIQ and the Company; the amount of redemption requests made by VectoIQ’s stockholders;
the occurrence of events that may give rise to a right of one or both of VectoIQ and the Company to terminate the Business Combination
Agreement; risks related to the rollout of the Company’s business and the timing of expected business milestones; the effects
of competition on the Company’s future business; and those factors discussed in VectoIQ’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 under the heading “Risk Factors,” and other documents of VectoIQ filed,
or to be filed, with the SEC. If the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from
the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that neither VectoIQ nor the Company presently
do not know or that VectoIQ and the Company currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from
those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect VectoIQ’s and the Company’s
expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. VectoIQ and
the Company anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause their assessments to change. However, while VectoIQ and
the Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, VectoIQ and the Company specifically
disclaim any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing VectoIQ’s or
the Company’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. Accordingly, undue
reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.
