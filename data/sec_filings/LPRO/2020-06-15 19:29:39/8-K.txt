 Introductory Note 
On June 10, 2020 (the Closing Date), Nebula Acquisition Corporation, our predecessor company (Nebula), consummated
the previously announced business combination (the Business Combination) pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2020 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Waiver, dated March 18,
2020 (the First Amendment) to the Business Combination Agreement, Amendment No. 2 and Consent, dated March 26, 2020 (the Second Amendment) to the Business Combination Agreement, and Amendment No. 3, dated
May 13, 2020 (the Third Amendment) to the Business Combination Agreement (collectively, the Business Combination Agreement)) with Open Lending, LLC., a Texas limited liability company (Open Lending), BRP Hold
11, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Blocker), the Blockers sole stockholder (the Blocker Holder), Nebula Parent Corp., a Delaware corporation (ParentCo), NBLA Merger Sub LLC, a Texas limited liability company
(Merger Sub LLC), NBLA Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation (Merger Sub Corp), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, as the Securityholder Representative. Pursuant to the
Business Combination Agreement, on the closing date, each of the following transactions occurred in the following order: (i) Merger Sub Corp merged with and into Nebula (the First Merger), with Nebula surviving the First Merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of ParentCo (the NAC Surviving Company); (ii) immediately following the First Merger and prior to the Blocker Contribution (as defined below), Blocker redeemed a specified number of shares of Blocker common stock
in exchange for cash (the Blocker Redemption); (iii) immediately following the Blocker Redemption, ParentCo acquired, and the Blocker Holder contributed to ParentCo the remaining shares of Blocker common stock after giving effect to the
Blocker Redemption (the Blocker Contribution) such that, following the Blocker Contribution, Blocker is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ParentCo; (iv) immediately following the Blocker Contribution, Merger Sub LLC merged with and into
Open Lending (the Second Merger), with Open Lending surviving the Second Merger as a direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ParentCo (the Surviving Company); (v) immediately following the Second Merger, Blocker
acquired, and ParentCo contributed to Blocker, all common units of the Surviving Company directly held by ParentCo after the Second Merger such that the Surviving Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blocker; and (vi) the NAC Surviving
Company acquired, and ParentCo contributed to the NAC Surviving Company, the remaining shares of Blocker common stock after giving effect to the Blocker Redemption and the Blocker Contribution (the ParentCo Blocker Contribution) such
that, following the ParentCo Blocker Contribution, Blocker is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NAC Surviving Company.  Immediately upon
the completion of the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the Transactions, and such completion, the Closing), Open Lending became a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of ParentCo. In connection with the Transactions, ParentCo changed its name to Open Lending Corporation (Open Lending Corporation). 
Unless the context otherwise requires, we, us, our, and the Company refer Open Lending
Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. All references herein to the Board refer to the board of directors of Open Lending Corporation. References to ParentCo herein refer to Open Lending Corporation prior
to the change of ParentCos name to Open Lending Corporation.   


Item 1.01.
 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
Founder Support Agreement  In
connection with the Closing, Nebula entered into the NAC Founder Support Agreement (the Founder Support Agreement), dated January 5, 2020 with the holders of the Nebula Class B Common Stock (including Nebula Holdings, LLC
(Sponsor)), pursuant to which, among other things:   


 

 
 Such holders agreed to approve the Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination; and
  


 

 
 Such holders agreed to forfeit (without consideration) all Nebula warrants held by them to Nebula, which warrants
constitute all of the warrants sold in the private placement consummated in connection with the closing of Nebulas initial public offering (the Private Placement Warrants). 
   1 












 

 
 The Sponsor agreed that to the extent the NAC Expenses (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) shall
exceed an amount equal to $25,000,000 plus the amount of cash as of the Reference Time (as defined in the Proxy Statement and Prospectus) held by Nebula without restriction outside of the Trust Account (as defined in the Proxy Statement and
Prospectus) and any interest earned on the amount of cash held inside the Trust Account (collectively, the NAC Expense Cap), then, the Sponsor shall, on the Closing Date, in its sole option, either (a) pay any such amount in excess
of the NAC Expense Cap to Nebula in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Nebula, or (b) forfeit to Nebula (for no consideration) such number of shares of Nebula Class B Common Stock (valued at
$10.00 per share of Nebula Class B Common Stock) held by the Sponsor that would, in the aggregate, have a value equal to such amount in excess of the NAC Expense Cap; provided, that if Sponsor shall elect to forfeit shares of Nebula
Class B Common Stock and the number of shares of Nebula Class B Common Stock available for forfeiture shall be insufficient to satisfy the Sponsors obligations to satisfy such excess NAC Expenses, then Sponsor shall, on the Closing
Date, satisfy any such additional NAC Expenses in cash on the Closing Date.   


 

 
 Such holders agreed to certain amendments to the lock up terms set forth in that certain letter agreement, dated
January 9, 2018, by and among Nebula and such holders, pursuant to which the lock up term will be extended for up to seven years following the Closing for half the shares held by such holders, depending on the trading price of the
ParentCos common stock (and subject to forfeiture if such trading prices are not reached).   


 

 
 Such holders waived any anti-dilution protections provided to holders of the Nebula Class B Common Stock in
Nebulas certificate of incorporation.   


 

 
 Such holders will be issued an aggregate of up to 1,250,000 additional shares of the Companys common stock

$14.00 over any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period (the Second Level Earn-Out Shares). If a change of control of the Company occurs
(i) prior to the second anniversary of the Closing, then the full First Level Earn-Out Shares and the Second Level Earn-Out Shares that remain unissued as of
immediately prior to the consummation of such change of control shall immediately vest and the holders of the Nebula Class B Common Stock, including the Sponsor, shall be entitled to receive such First Level
Earn-Out Shares and the Second Level Earn-Out Shares prior to the consummation of such change of control and (ii) after the second anniversary of the Closing but
prior to 30-month anniversary of the Closing, then the Second Level Earn-Out Shares that remain unissued as of immediately prior to the consummation of such change of
control shall immediately vest and the holders of the Nebula Class B Common Stock, including the Sponsor, shall be entitled to receive such Second Level Earn-Out Shares prior to the consummation of such
change of control.  As previously stated, Nebula and Nebula Holdings, LLC is each a party to the Founder Support Agreement. Nebula is

Open Lending Corporation 2020 Stock Option and Incentive Plan 
At the special meeting of Nebula stockholders held on June 9, 2020, Nebula stockholders considered and approved the 2020 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan). The Company has initially reserved 9,693,750 shares of Company common stock outstanding upon the Closing for the issuance of awards under the 2020 Plan. The 2020 Plan provides that the number of shares
reserved and available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2021, by 4.0% of the outstanding number of shares of Company common stock on the immediately preceding December 31
(the Annual Increase). This limit is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in the capitalization of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries

   4 









 
after giving effect to the Business Combination (the Combined Company). The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of incentive stock
options under the 2020 Plan shall not exceed the initial limit cumulatively increased on January 1, 2021 and on each January 1 thereafter by the lesser of the Annual Increase or 14,540,625 shares of Stock. Based upon a price per share of
$10.00, the maximum aggregate market value of the common stock that could potentially be issued under the 2020 Plan is $96,937,500.                . 
The 2020 Plan contains a limitation whereby the value of all awards under the 2020 Plan and all other cash compensation paid by the Combined
Company to any non-employee director for services as a non-employee director may not exceed $750,000 in any calendar year. 
The 2020 Plan will be administered by the Combined Companys compensation committee, the Board or such other similar committee pursuant
to the terms of the 2020 Plan. The administrator, which initially will be the compensation committee, will have full power to select, from among the individuals eligible for awards, the individuals to whom awards will be granted, to make any
combination of awards to participants, and to determine the specific terms and conditions of each award, subject to the provisions of the 2020 Plan. The administrator may delegate to the chief executive officer the authority to grant stock options
and other awards to employees who are not subject to the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, subject to certain limitations and guidelines. Persons eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan will be those full or
part-time officers, employees, non-employee directors and other key persons (including consultants) as selected from time to time by the administrator in its discretion. Approximately 97 individuals are
currently eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan, which includes approximately six officers, 83 employees who are not officers, seven non-employee directors, and one consultant. 
The 2020 Plan permits the granting of both options to purchase common stock intended to qualify as incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Code and options that do not so qualify. Options granted under the 2020 Plan will be non-qualified options if they fail to qualify as incentive options or exceed the annual limit on
incentive stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Non-qualified options may be granted to any persons eligible to receive incentive options
and to non-employee directors and key persons. The option exercise price of each option will be determined by the administrator but may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant unless the option is granted (i) pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code or (ii) to individuals who are not subject to U.S. income tax. The term of each option
will be fixed by our administrator and may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The administrator will determine at what time or times each option may be exercised, including the ability to accelerate the vesting of such options. 
Upon exercise of options, the option exercise price must be paid in full either in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument
acceptable to the compensation committee or by delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares of common stock that are beneficially owned by the optionee for at least six months or were purchased in the open market. Subject to applicable law,
the exercise price may also be delivered by a broker pursuant to irrevocable instructions to the broker from the optionee. In addition, the compensation committee may permit non-qualified options to be
exercised using a net exercise feature which reduces the number of shares issued to the optionee by the number of shares with fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price. 
The Combined Companys compensation committee may award stock appreciation rights subject to such conditions and restrictions as it may
determine. Stock appreciation rights entitle the recipient to shares of common stock, or cash, equal to the value of the appreciation in our stock price over the exercise price. The exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair market value
of our common stock on the date of grant. The term of each stock appreciation right will be fixed by the administrator and may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The administrator will determine at what time or times each stock
appreciation right may be exercised.  The administrator may award restricted shares of common stock and restricted stock units to
participants subject to such conditions and restrictions as it may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals and/or continued employment with us through a specified vesting period. The
administrator may also grant shares of common stock that are free from any restrictions under the 2020 Plan. Unrestricted stock may be granted to participants in recognition of past services or for other valid consideration and may be issued in lieu
of cash compensation due to such participant. The administrator may grant dividend equivalent rights to participants that entitle the recipient to receive credits for dividends that would be paid if the recipient had held a specified number of
shares of common stock. 
   5 









 The administrator may grant cash bonuses under the 2020 Plan to participants, subject to the
achievement of certain performance goals.  The 2020 Plan provides that upon the effectiveness of a sale event, as defined in
the 2020 Plan, an acquirer or successor entity may assume, continue or substitute outstanding awards under the 2020 Plan. To the extent that awards granted under the 2020 Plan are not assumed or continued or substituted by the successor entity, upon
the effective time of the sale event, such awards under the 2020 Plan shall terminate. In such case, except as may be otherwise provided in the relevant award agreement, all options and stock appreciation rights with time-based vesting, conditions
of restrictions that are not exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the sale event will become fully exercisable as of the effective time of the sale event, all other awards with time-based vesting, conditions or restrictions, will
become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the effective time of the sale event and all awards with conditions and restrictions relating to the attainment of performance goals may become vested and nonforfeitable in the discretion of the
administrator. In the event of such termination, individuals holding options and stock appreciation rights will be permitted to exercise such options and stock appreciation rights (to the extent exercisable) within a specified period of time prior
to the sale event. In addition, in connection with the termination of the 2020 Plan upon a sale event, we may make or provide for a cash payment to participants holding vested and exercisable options and stock appreciation rights equal to the
difference between the per share cash consideration payable to stockholders in the sale event and the exercise price of the options or stock appreciation rights and we may make or provide for a cash payment to participants holding other vested
awards.  Participants in the 2020 Plan are responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes that the Combined Company is
required by law to withhold upon the exercise of options or stock appreciation rights or vesting of other awards. Subject to approval by the compensation committee, participants may elect to have the minimum tax withholding obligations satisfied by
authorizing the Combined Company to withhold shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to the exercise or vesting of such award.  The
administrator may amend or discontinue the 2020 Plan and the administrator may amend or cancel outstanding awards for purposes of satisfying changes in law or any other lawful purpose, but no such action may adversely affect rights under an award
without the holders consent. Certain amendments to the 2020 Plan require the approval of the Combined Companys stockholders. 
No awards may be granted under the 2020 Plan after the date that is ten years from the date of stockholder approval of the 2020 Plan. No
awards under the 2020 Plan have been made prior to the date hereof. A more complete summary of the terms of the 2020 Plan is set forth in the Proxy Statement and Prospectus included in the Companys Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333- 237264) in the section titled Nebula Stockholder Proposal No. 4The 2020 Plan Proposal. That
summary and the foregoing description of the 2020 Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the 2020 Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.10 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. 
Credit Agreement  Open Lending has
a term loan outstanding in the original principal amount of $170,000,000 (the Term Loan), that was incurred under that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of March 11, 2020, among Open Lending, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as
administrative agent, the lenders from time to time party thereto and the other parties thereto, as amended (the Credit Agreement). The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to, among other things, finance a distribution to Open
Lendings equity investors prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. The Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR + 6.50% or the base rate + 5.50%. The obligations of Open Lending under the Credit Agreement are
guaranteed by all of its subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the assets of Open Lending and its subsidiaries, in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Term Loan has a maturity date of March 11, 2027. Subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, Open Lending may be required to make certain mandatory prepayments prior to maturity. Voluntary prepayments and certain mandatory prepayments may be subject to certain prepayment premiums
in the first 2 years after the date thereof.

Item 3.02.
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. 
As previously discussed, in connection with the Transactions, Nebula obtained commitments from subscribers to purchase shares of Nebula
Class A Common Stock, which were converted into PIPE Shares for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, in the PIPE. Several fundamental investors committed an aggregate of $200 million to participate in the transaction through the PIPE
anchored by True Wind Capital. True Wind Capital agreed to subscribe for $85,000,000 worth of such PIPE Shares for a purchase price of $10.00 per share. Such commitments were made by way of the Subscription Agreements dated as of January 5,
2020, by and among each Subscriber, Nebula, Open Lending and ParentCo. Certain offering related expenses are payable by Nebula, including customary fees payable to the placement agents, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs. 
The PIPE Shares are identical to the shares of common stock that are held by the Public Stockholders (as defined in the Proxy Statement and
Prospectus) at the time of the Closing, other than the PIPE Shares, when initially issued by Nebula in connection with the PIPE Closing, and such shares are not be registered with the SEC nor available to trade on NASDAQ. These securities were
issued pursuant to and in accordance with the exemption from registration under the Securities Act, under Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. 
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, ParentCo agreed that, within 45 calendar days after the consummation of the Proposed Transactions,
the Company will file with the SEC (at the Companys sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the shares of common stock received by the Subscriber in connection with the Proposed Transactions (the Resale
Registration Statement), and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Resale Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof; provided, however, that the Companys
obligations to include the shares held by a Subscriber in the Resale Registration Statement will be contingent upon the respective Subscriber furnishing in writing, to the Company, such information regarding the Subscriber, the securities of the
Company held by such Subscriber and the intended method of disposition of the shares, as shall be reasonably requested by the Company to effect the registration of such shares, and will execute such documents in connection with such registration, as
the Company may reasonably request, which will be what is customary of a selling stockholder in similar situations.  Immediately upon the
completion of the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, Open Lending became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of ParentCo. In connection with the Transactions, ParentCo changed its name to
Open Lending Corporation.

(B)
 changed the vote required to remove a director of ParentCo from a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class to not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock
entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting together as a single class and the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to
vote thereon; and   


 
(C)
 changed the vote required to amend ParentCos bylaws from a majority of the members of the Nebula board or
by the stockholders, or by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of Nebula entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, to not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock generally entitled to vote, voting together as a single class; provided, however that if the board of directors recommends that stockholders approve such
amendment or repeal at such meeting of stockholders, such amendment or repeal shall only require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, voting together as a
single class.  The shareholders of Nebula approved the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation at the Special
Meeting, which have become the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ParentCo upon the Closing of the Business Combination. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, which is included as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  Amended and Restated Bylaws 
The shareholders of Nebula approved the amended and restated bylaws at the Special Meeting, which have become the amended and restated bylaws
of ParentCo upon the Closing of the Business Combination. These amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive
forum for any state law claim for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of ours to us or
our stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a
claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or the Delaware Forum Provision. The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Our amended and restated bylaws further
provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action
arising under the Securities Act, or the Federal Forum Provision. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity 
   13 









 
purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Companys Common Stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum
Provision; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text
of the amended and restated bylaws, which is included as Exhibit 3.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
