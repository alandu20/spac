Item 3.02.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

On December
13, 2018, simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of
units (“Units”) of Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), the Company
consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 4,150,000 warrants (the
“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of
$4,150,000. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the Private Placement. The Private Placement
was conducted as a non-public transaction and, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering, is exempt from
registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the
“Securities Act”). In the Private Placement, Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (the
“Sponsor”) purchased 4,150,000 Private Placement Warrants. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to
the warrants underlying the Units, except that if held by the original holder or their permitted assigns, they (i) may
be exercised on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to redemption and (iii) subject to certain limited
exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until after the completion of the Company’s initial business
combination. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than the initial purchaser or its permitted
transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same
basis as the warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO. 

 

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers;
Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

 

Effective as of December
10, 2018, the following individuals were appointed to the board of directors of the Company: Gary M. Julien, William G. LaPerch,
William T. Allen and John J. Walker. Additional information regarding, among other things, each individual’s background,
board committee membership and compensatory arrangements is contained in the Registration Statement (as defined in Item 8.01 below)
and is incorporated by reference herein.

 

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On December 10, 2018,
the Company filed its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which was effective the same day. Among other things, the Certificate of Incorporation
authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”),
and up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The terms of the Certificate of Incorporation are set
forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Certificate of Incorporation
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Incorporation, which is attached as Exhibit 3.1
hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

 

Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

 On December 13, 2018, the Company completed
its IPO of 13,000,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock and one warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each
Public Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The
Company completed its IPO pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-228494)
(the “Registration Statement”). The Registration Statement was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on December 10, 2018. 

 

In connection with
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the closing of the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements:

 


●An Underwriting Agreement, dated December 10, 2018, between the Company and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EBC”), as
representative of the several underwriters;

 


●A Letter Agreement, dated December 10, 2018, between the Company and EBC;

●A Letter Agreement, dated December 10, 2018, from the Sponsor and each of the Company’s officers and directors;

 


●An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated December 10, 2018, between the Company and Continental;

 


●A Stock Escrow Agreement, dated December 10, 2018, among the Company, Continental and the Initial Stockholders;

 


●A Registration Rights Agreement, dated December 10, 2018, among the Company and the Initial Stockholders;

 


●A Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated December 10, 2018, between the Company and the Sponsor; and

 


●An Administrative Services Agreement, dated December 10, 2018, between the Company and the Sponsor.

 

A total of $130,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s
public stockholders (the “Trust Account”), with Continental acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal of interest
to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the Trust Account will be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the
completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the
Company’s obligation to allow redemption rights in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the
Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing
of its IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity
and (iii) the redemption of 100% of the Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete an initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of its IPO.

 

In connection with
the IPO, the Company issued a press release announcing the closing of the IPO, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1
and is incorporated by reference herein.
