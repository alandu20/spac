Item 3.01.Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 

On
January 2, 2020, Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) received a written notice (the “Notice”)
from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company is not
in compliance with Listing Rule 5620(a), due to the Company’s failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve
months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year end. The Notice is only a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting,
and has no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s securities on the NASDAQ Capital Market.

 

The Notice states that
the Company has until February 17, 2020 to submit a plan to regain compliance with Listing
Rule 5620(a). The Company intends to submit a plan to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5620(a) within the required timeframe.
If Nasdaq accepts the Company’s plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the fiscal
year end, or until June 29, 2020, to evidence compliance with Listing Rule 5620(a). If Nasdaq does not accept the Company’s
plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a Nasdaq Hearings Panel.
