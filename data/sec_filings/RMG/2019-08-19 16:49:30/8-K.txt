    Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule

On August 15, 2019,
RMG Acquisition Corp. (the “Company” or “RMG”) received written notice from The New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE” or the “Exchange”) that it is not compliant with Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual
(the “Manual”), which requires the Company to maintain a minimum of 300 public stockholders on a continuous basis.

 

In accordance with
the procedures set forth in Sections 801 and 802 of the Manual, RMG has been provided a period of 45 days to respond with a business
plan that demonstrates how the Company expects to return to compliance with the minimum public stockholders requirement within
18 months.

 

RMG intends to submit
a business plan to resolve its noncompliance with the minimum public stockholders requirement to the Exchange for review within
the allotted time. The Listings Operations Committee (the “Committee”) of the NYSE will review the business plan. If
the Committee accepts the business plan, the Company will be subject to quarterly monitoring for compliance with the plan. If the
Committee rejects the business plan, then RMG will be subject to suspension and delisting procedures. RMG’s units, common
stock and warrants will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the cure period, subject to compliance with the Exchange’s
other applicable continued listing standards.
