Separate Trading of Class A Common Stock and Warrants

 

On March 29, 2019, RMG Acquisition Corp.
(the “Company”) announced that, commencing on April 1, 2019, the holders of the Company’s units (the “Units”)
may elect to separately trade the securities underlying such Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”) and one-third of one warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only
whole warrants will trade. Any Units not separated will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under
the symbol “RMG.U”. Any shares of Class A Common Stock and warrants that are separated will trade on the NYSE under
the symbols “RMG” and “RMG.WS”, respectively. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the holders’ Units
into shares of Class A Common Stock and warrants.

 

A copy of the Press Release issued by the
Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
