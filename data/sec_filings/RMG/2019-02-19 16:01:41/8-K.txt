Item 5.02.Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements
of Certain Officers.

 

On February 19, 2019, the Board of Directors
(the “Board”) of RMG Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) increased the size of the Board to six members and
elected Craig Broderick, 59, as a director of the Company, to serve until the Company’s second annual meeting of stockholders.
The Board determined that Mr. Broderick is an independent director under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the
“NYSE”) and under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and qualifies as financially
literate. Mr. Broderick also has been appointed to serve as a member of the Audit Committee of the Board. In connection with this
appointment and consistent with NYSE’s phase-in exemptions, Robert S. Mancini, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
has resigned from the Audit Committee of the Board.

 

Craig Broderick was a Senior Director of Goldman,
Sachs & Co., from which he retired as an active employee in January 2018 after a 32 year career. He was most recently the firm’s
Chief Risk Officer, a member of its Management Committee, and chair or co-chair of key risk committees. Mr. Broderick reported
to the firm’s CEO and was responsible for managing the firm’s Risk Division, which oversees control of the firm’s
credit, market, liquidity, operational, model and insurance risks. Prior to his tenure at Goldman, Mr. Broderick was a lending
officer at the Chase Manhattan Bank. Mr. Broderick also currently serves as a Director of the Bank of Montreal and is a Senior
Advisor to Stone Point Capital, a private equity firm primarily investing in the global financial services industry. Mr. Broderick
previously served for nine years as a Trustee of the William and Mary Foundation and was chair of its Investment Committee. Mr.
Broderick graduated with a BA in Economics from the College of William and Mary. Mr. Broderick is well-qualified to serve as a
member of the Board due to his extensive experience with risk management and his finance background.

 

There are no arrangements or understandings
between Mr. Broderick and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Broderick was appointed as a director of the Company. In addition,
there are no family relationships between Mr. Broderick and any director, executive officer, or person nominated or chosen by the
Company to become a director or executive officer. Furthermore, since the inception of the Company, there have been no transactions
in which the Company was or is to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which Mr. Broderick had or
will have a direct or material interest, and there are currently no such proposed transactions.

 

The Company has entered into an Indemnity Agreement
with Mr. Broderick, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

 


Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure.

 

On February 19, 2019, the Company issued a press
release announcing the closing of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units (as defined below) to
cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-allotment Option”). A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to
this Current Report on Form 8-K, and the contents thereof are incorporated herein by reference.

 


Item 8.01.Other Events.

 

On February 12, 2019, the Company consummated
its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one
share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), of the Company and
one-third of one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase
one whole share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $200,000,000. On February 12, 2019, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company
completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 4,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”)
at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant (the “Private Placement”), to the Company’s sponsor,
RMG Sponsor, LLC, and certain institutional investors, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,000,000.

On February 19, 2019, the Company consummated
the closing of the Over-Allotment Option, pursuant to which the underwriters purchased an aggregate of 3,000,000 additional Units
(the “Over-Allotment Units”), which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $30,000,000. On February 19, 2019, in connection with the sale of Over-Allotment Units, the Company completed a
private sale of an additional 600,000 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor and certain institutional investors, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $900,000.

 

A total of $230,000,000, comprised of $225,400,000
of the proceeds from the IPO, including $8,050,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount, and $4,600,000 of the proceeds
from the Private Placement, were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

The Company has provided (i) an audited balance
sheet as of February 12, 2019, reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement (which
excludes the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants on February
19, 2019) and (ii) an unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of February 12, 2019, reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale
of the Over-Allotment Units and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants on February 19, 2019, each of which is included in Exhibit 99.2
to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively.
