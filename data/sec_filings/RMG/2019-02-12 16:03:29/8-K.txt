Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On February 12, 2019, RMG Acquisition Corp.
(the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”).
Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”),
of the Company and one-third of one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00
per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $200,000,000.

 

In connection with the IPO, the Company
entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (File
No. 333-228849) (the “Registration Statement”):

 


·An Underwriting Agreement, dated February 7, 2019, between the Company and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representative
of the several underwriters.


·An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated February 7, 2019, between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as trustee.


·A Warrant Agreement, dated February 7, 2019, between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant
agent.


·A Registration Rights Agreement, dated February 7, 2019, among the Company and certain security holders named therein.


·A Letter Agreement, dated February 7, 2019, among the Company, its officers and directors and RMG Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”).


·Indemnity Agreements, each dated February 7, 2019, between the Company and each of its officers, directors and advisory board
members.

 


Item 3.02.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO,
the Company completed the private sale of 4,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price
of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant (the “Private Placement”), to the Sponsor and certain institutional investors
(the “Institutional Investors” and, together with the Sponsor, the “Private Placement Investors”), generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $6,000,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units
in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Investors have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement
Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.
So long as the Private Placement Warrants are held by the Private Placement Investors or their permitted transferees, the Private
Placement Warrants will not be redeemable for cash by the Company and will be exercisable on a cashless basis .

 


Item 5.03.Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On February 7, 2019, the Company filed its
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the State of Delaware. The terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation are set forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

 


Item 8.01.Other Events.

 

A total of $200,000,000, comprised of $196,000,000
of the proceeds from the IPO, including $7,000,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount, and $4,000,000 of the proceeds
from the Private Placement, were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the trust account
that may be released to the Company to pay its franchise and income taxes and expenses relating to the administration of the trust
account, the proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement held in the trust account will not be released until the earliest
of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to
modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO and (iii) the redemption of all of the Company’s public
shares if it is unable to complete its business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable
law.
