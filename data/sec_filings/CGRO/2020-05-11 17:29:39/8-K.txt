Item 3.02.Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities.

 

The information provided
in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.

 


Item 8.01.Other Events.

 

On May 5, 2020,
Collective Growth Corporation (the “Company”) consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 15,000,000 of its units (“Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A Common Stock, $0.0001 par value
per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with
each whole Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000.

	Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of an
aggregate of 262,500 units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit and an aggregate of 1,875,000
warrants (“Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $4,500,000.
Such securities were sold to certain of the Company’s initial stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the underwriter
of the IPO. The Private Units and Private Warrants are identical to the Units and Warrants sold in the IPO, except that the Private
Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial
purchasers or their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the Private Units and Private Warrants have agreed not to transfer,
assign, or sell any of such securities (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s
initial business combination.

	An audited balance
sheet as of May 5, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the consummation of the IPO
and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. A
copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement is included as Exhibit
99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
