Item
                          2.03.Creation
                                         of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
                                         of a Registrant.

As
previously disclosed in LF Capital Acquisition Corp.’s (the “Company”) Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2019, the
Company issued a convertible note (“Convertible Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to provide
a working capital loan to the Company of up to $1.5 million. The Company was provided $400,000 in loan proceeds on March 4, 2019
pursuant to the Convertible Note. The Convertible Note will either be repaid upon consummation of a business combination, without
interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the Convertible Note may be convertible into warrants of the
post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Company’s warrants
previously issued in a private placement contemporaneous with the Company’s initial public offering. On March 16, 2020,
the Company was provided an advance of $300,000 in additional loan proceeds pursuant to the Convertible Note which increased the
principal balance of the Note to $1,180,000. As previously disclosed in prior SEC filings, the Company was provided $400,000,
$350,000 and $130,000 in loan proceeds on March 4, 2019, August 19, 2019 and January 10, 2020, respectively.
