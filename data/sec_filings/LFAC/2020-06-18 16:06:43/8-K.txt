Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

The
disclosure contained in Item 2.03 is incorporated by reference in this Item 1.01

Item
2.03	Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet 		Arrangement of a Registrant.

As
previously disclosed in LF Capital Acquisition Corp.’s (the “Company”) Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2019, the
Company issued a convertible note (“Convertible Note”) to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to provide
a working capital loan to the Company of up to $1.5 million. The Convertible Note will either be repaid upon consummation of a
business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the Convertible Note may be
convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical
to the Company’s warrants previously issued in a private placement contemporaneous with the Company’s initial public
offering.

On
June 16, 2020, the Company was provided an advance of $320,000 in additional loan proceeds pursuant to the Convertible Note which
increased the principal balance of the Note to $1,500,000. As previously disclosed in prior SEC filings, the Company was provided
$400,000, $350,000, $130,000 and 300,000, in loan proceeds on March 4, 2019, August 19, 2019, January 10, 2020 and March 16, respectively.

On
June 16, 2020 the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) approved an amendment to the Convertible Note (the
“Note Amendment”) pursuant to which the maturity date of the note was extended to the earlier of (i) December 31,
2020 and (ii) the effective date of a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination, involving the Company and one or more businesses. The foregoing description of the Note
Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.

extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization
or similar business combination with one or more businesses from June 22, 2020 to September 22, 2020 (the “Extension”).
The Company’s stockholders approved the Extension Amendment at a special meeting of stockholders of the Company (the “Special Meeting”)
on June 16, 2020. The foregoing description of the Extension Amendment is qualified in its entirety
by the full text of the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
