Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale
of an aggregate of 7,7600,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor and certain funds and
accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred to as our “Anchor Investor”) at a purchase
price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,760,0,000.  Among the
private placement warrants, 7,209,560 warrants were purchased by the Sponsor and 550,440 warrants were purchased by the Anchor
investor. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants
sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor and the Anchor Investor have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell
any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s
initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable by the Company so long as they are held by
the Sponsor, the Anchor Investor or their permitted transferees. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect
to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Company’s initial business combination.

 

On June 19, 2018, in
connection with their appointments to the Board, each of the Directors entered into indemnity agreements with the Company filed

nor are they party to any transactions required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K involving the Company, other
than the Agreement with B. Prot Conseil (the “Prot Agreement”), an entity controlled by Baudouin Prot, pursuant to
which Mr. Prot receives $12,500 per month through December 2019. The Prot Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.12 to Amendment No.
1 to the Registration Statement filed with the Commission on June 13, 2018.
