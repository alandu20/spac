Item 8.01.Other Events.

 

On June 22, 2018, LF
Capital Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 15,525,000
units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 2,025,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s exercise of their
over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share
(the “Class A Common Stock”), and one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder
thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price
of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $155,250,000.

 

Simultaneously with
the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 7,760,000 warrants (the
 “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Company’s sponsor, Level Field Capital, LLC (the “Sponsor”),
and certain funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred
to as our “Anchor Investor”), at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant generating gross proceeds
to the Company of $7,760,000.  Among the private placement warrants, 7,209,560 warrants were purchased by the Sponsor and
550,440 warrants were purchased by the Anchor investor. 

 

A total of $158,355,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account established for the benefit
of the Company’s public stockholders at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, acting as trustee. 

 

An audited balance
sheet as of June 22, 2018, reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement, has been
issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
