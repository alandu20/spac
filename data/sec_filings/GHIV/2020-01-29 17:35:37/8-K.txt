Item 8.01
 Other Events. 
On January 28, 2020, Gores Holdings IV, Inc. (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (the
IPO) of 42,500,000 units (the Units), including the issuance of 2,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of
Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Common Stock), and one-fourth of one warrant of the Company (Warrant), each whole Warrant entitling
the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $425,000,000. 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of 5,250,000 warrants (the Private Placement
Warrants) at a purchase price of $2.00 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Companys sponsor, Gores Sponsor IV LLC (the Sponsor), generating gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $10,500,000. The Private
Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days
after the completion of the Companys initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable by the Company so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. 
A total of $425,000,000, comprised of $416,5000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO, including approximately $14,875,000 of the
underwriters deferred discount, and $8,500,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, were placed in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds in the trust account that may be released to the Company to fund its working capital requirements and to fund regulatory compliance requirements and other costs related thereto subject to an annual limit of
$1,100,000, plus additional amounts necessary to pay its franchise and income taxes, if any, the proceeds from the IPO will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Companys initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of its obligation
to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial
business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of the Companys public shares if it is unable to complete its business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law. 
On January 24, 2020, in connection with the IPO, the Company filed its previously approved Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Company registration statement (File No. 333-235378):
