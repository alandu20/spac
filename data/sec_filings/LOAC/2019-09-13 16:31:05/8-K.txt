Item 2.03Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation
under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant


 

On September
13, 2019, Longevity Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”)
in the principal amount of up to $800,000 to Whale Management Corporation (the “Sponsor”). The Note bears no interest
and is repayable in full upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination. The Sponsor has the option to convert
any unpaid balance of the Note into units, each unit consisting of one ordinary share of the Company, one warrant exercisable for
one-half (1/2) of one ordinary share of the Company and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share of the Company
upon the consummation of an initial business combination, based on a conversion price of $10.00 per unit. The terms of any such
units shall be identical to the terms of the units issued pursuant to the private placement that was consummated by the Company
in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. As of the date hereof, the Sponsor has funded $450,000 of the Note.

 

The
issuance of the Note was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.

 

The Note is attached as Exhibit
10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The disclosure set forth in this Item 2.03 is
intended to be a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Note.
