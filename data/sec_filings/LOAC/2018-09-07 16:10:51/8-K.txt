    Other Events.

 

On August 31, 2018,
Longevity Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 4,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of the Company, no par value (the
 “Ordinary Shares”), one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant
entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per whole share and one right to receive one-tenth
(1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination. The Units were sold at a price
of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $40,000,000. 

 

On August 31, 2018,
simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”)
of an aggregate of 270,000 Units (the “Private Placement Units”), including 250,000 Private Placement Units
to Whale Management Corporation and 20,000 Private Placement Units to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $2,700,000.

 	

A total of $40,000,000,
comprised of $37,300,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and $2,700,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units,
was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance
