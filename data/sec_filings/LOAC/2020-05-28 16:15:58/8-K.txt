Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws;
Change in Fiscal Year.

 

        On
May 27, 2020, in connection with the Special Meeting (as defined below), Longevity Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”)
filed with the Register of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum
and Articles of Association (the “Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association”) to extend the
date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from May 29, 2020 to November 30, 2020, a copy of which is attached

of shareholders virtually via live webcast. At the Special Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the following items:
(i) an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company must
consummate a business combination (the “Extension”) from May 29, 2020 to November 30, 2020 (such date or later
date, as applicable, the “Extended Date”) (the “Extension Proposal”), and (ii) a proposal
to elect each of Messrs. Jun Liu and Pai Liu as Class I directors of the Company with each
such director to serve until the second annual general meeting of shareholders following the Special Meeting or until his or her
successor is elected and qualified (the “Director Proposal”). The affirmative vote of at least 65% of the ordinary
shares of the Company, no par value (the “Ordinary Shares”) entitled to vote which were present, in person or
by proxy, at the Special Meeting and which voted on the Extension Proposal was required to approve the Extension Proposal. The
affirmative vote of a majority of the Company’s ordinary shares entitled to vote which were present (in person or by proxy)
at the Special Meeting and which vote on the Director Proposal is required to elect each of the two nominees pursuant to the Director
