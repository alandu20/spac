    Item 5.02.
    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.


On January 23, 2020, Jason Zhang resigned as a Class II director of Longevity Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”)
to pursue other professional interests.

 

On January 23, 2020, the board of directors (the “Board”)
of the Company appointed Yukman Lau as a Class II director to serve until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders of the Company.
Ms. Lau has also been appointed to serve as a member of the audit committee of the Board and as a member of the compensation committee
of the Board.

 

Yukman Lau has served as a partner of Guoxing Asset Co.,
Ltd., an investment company in China, since June 2016. From June 2006 to June 2016, she served as president of Oriental
Infinite Media Co., Ltd., a professional media and event planning company in China. From 1997 to 2005, Ms. Lau served as
chairman of Dalian Chronos Information Co., Ltd., a business information consulting company in China. From 1993 to 1996, she
served as vice president of Shenzhen Maniche Consulting Company, a management consulting company in China. From 1989 to 1992,
Ms. Lau served as general manager assistant of Oriental Textile Industry Co., Ltd., a textile production and processing
company in China. Previously, she served as a manager of China Foreign Trade Import and Export Corporation and as business
director of Liaoning Textile Import and Export Corporation in China. Prior to that, Ms. Lau served as an accountant at Dalian
Steel Plant in China. Ms. Lau received her bachelor’s degree from Dalian University.

 

We believe Ms. Lau is well qualified to serve on our board of
directors because of her extensive business and management experience in China.

 

There were no arrangements or understandings between Ms. Lau
and any other persons pursuant to which Ms. Lau was appointed as a director of the Company. In addition, there are no family relationships
between Ms. Lau and any director, executive officer, or person nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive
officer. Furthermore, since the inception of the Company, there have been no transactions in which the Company was or is to be
a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which Ms. Lau had or will have a direct or indirect material interest,
and there are currently no such proposed transactions.
