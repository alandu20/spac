    Item 8.01.
    Other Events.

 

On October 12, 2018,
Longevity Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) announced that, commencing on October 16, 2018, the holders
of the Company’s units issued in the Company’s initial public offering (the “Units”) may elect to separately
trade the securities included in the Units. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share, no par value per share (“Ordinary Share”),
one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination
(“Right”), and one warrant to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share (“Warrant”). The Units not separated
will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “LOACU.” The Ordinary Shares,
the Rights and the Warrants are expected to trade on Nasdaq under the symbols “LOAC,” “LOACR” and “LOACW,”
respectively. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s
transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into Ordinary Shares, Rights and Warrants.

 

Because the underwriters’
over-allotment option in connection with the Company’s initial public offering was not exercised, Whale Management Corporation
forfeited 150,000 Ordinary Shares.

 

A copy of the press
release issued by the Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is included as Exhibit 99.1
to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
