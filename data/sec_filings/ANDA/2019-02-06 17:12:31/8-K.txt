Item
3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

The
information provided in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.

 

 Item 8.01. Other Events.



 

On
January 31, 2019, the Company consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”) of 10,800,000 of its units (“Units”),
including 800,000 Units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share, $0.0001
par value per share (“Ordinary Share”), one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth of one
Ordinary Share, and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder to purchase
one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds of $108,000,000.

 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 395,000
Units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,950,000, to
certain of the Company’s initial shareholders, Cowen and Company, LLC and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, the joint book-running
managers of the IPO, and their respective affiliates. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that
the Warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as
they continue to be held by the initial shareholders or their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the Private Units have
agreed (A) to vote the Ordinary Shares underlying the Private Units in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to
propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
with respect to the Company’s pre-business combination activities prior to the consummation of such a business combination
unless the Company provides public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such
vote, (C) not to convert any Ordinary Shares underlying the Private Units for cash from the trust account in connection with a
shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of the Company’s amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity,
and (D) that the Ordinary Shares underlying the Private Units shall not participate in any liquidating distribution from the trust
account upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated. The purchasers of Private Units have also agreed not to
transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except to certain permitted transferees) until the
completion of the Company’s initial business combination.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of January 31, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the
consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement
is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
