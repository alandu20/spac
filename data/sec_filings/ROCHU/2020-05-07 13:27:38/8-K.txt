Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On May 4, 2020, the registration statement
(File No. 333-236852) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering (“IPO”) of
Roth CH Acquisition I Co. (the “Company”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection
therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:

 



     
    ●
    An Underwriting Agreement, dated May 4, 2020, by and between the Company, Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC and BTIG, LLC;





     
    ●
    A Warrant Agreement, dated May 4, 2020, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;





     
    ●
    Letter Agreements, dated May 4, 2020, by and between the Company’s officers, directors and shareholders;





     
    ●
    An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated May 4, 2020, by and between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the Company;





     
    ●
    An Escrow Agreement, dated May 4, 2020, by and among the Company, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and each of the initial shareholders of the Company; and

     
    ●
    Indemnity Agreements, dated May 4, 2020, by and among the Company and the directors and officers of the Company;

     
    ●
    A Subscription Agreement, dated May 4, 2020, by and between the Company and the initial shareholders of the Company; and





     
    ●
    A Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 4, 2020, by and among the Company and the initial shareholders of the Company.

     
     
     



On May 7, 2020, the Company consummated
the IPO of 7,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common
Stock”), and three-quarters of one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling the holder of each whole Warrant to purchase
one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of $75,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Units
to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

As of May 7, 2020, a total of $75,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for
the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. An audited balance sheet as of May 7, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds
upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement will be filed within 4 business days of the consummation of the IPO.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the
IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with initial shareholders of the Company of
262,500 units (the “Private Units”), generating total proceeds of $2,625,000.

 

The Private Units are identical to the
Units sold as part of the public Units in this offering except that the Warrants underlying the Private Units will be non-redeemable
and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted
transferees.. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying
securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s
initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection
with the purchase of the Private Units.

 

The Private Units were issued pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.

 




     
     
    

 

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On May 4, 2020, in connection with the
IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State. The terms of
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are set forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by
reference.
