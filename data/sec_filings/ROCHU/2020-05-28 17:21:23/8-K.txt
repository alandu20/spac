The information included in Item 8.01 is incorporated into this

Item 8.01. Other Events

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K dated March 4, 2020, Roth CH Acquisition I Co. (the “Company”), consummated its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of 7,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Common
Stock”) and three-quarters of one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling the holder of each whole Warrant to purchase
one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of $75,000,000.The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Units
to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

As also previously disclosed in the Current
Report, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”)
of 262,500 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,625,000.

 

Subsequently, on May 22, 2020, the underwriters
exercised the over-allotment option in part, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the “Over-Allotment
Option Units”) on May 26, 2020. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 150,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit
resulted in total gross proceeds of $1,500,000. On May 26, 2020, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units,
the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 3,000 Private Units, generating gross proceeds of $30,000. The Private
Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a
public offering.

 

On May 26, 2020, the underwriters canceled
the remainder of the over-allotment option. In connection with the cancellation of the remainder of the over-allotment option,
the Company has canceled an aggregate of 243,750 shares of Common Stock issued to certain stockholder of the Company prior to the
IPO and Private Placement.

 

A total of $76,500,000 of the net proceeds
from the sale of Units in the initial public offering (including the Over-Allotment Option Units) and the Private Placements on
May 7, 2020 and May 26, 2020, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders.
Included with this report as Exhibit 99.1 is a pro-forma balance sheet reflecting the exercise of the over-allotment option.
