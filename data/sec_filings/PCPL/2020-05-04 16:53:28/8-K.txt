Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

On April 28, 2020,
CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (the “Company”) consummated an initial public offering (the “IPO”) of
41,400,000 units (the “Units”) at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, which includes the exercise in full of the
underwriter’s option to purchase an additional 5,400,000 Units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments,
and a private placement with CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) of 10,280,000 private placement
warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant (the “Private Placement”). The net proceeds from the IPO together with certain
of the proceeds from the Private Placement, $414,000,000 in the aggregate (the “Offering Proceeds”), were placed in
a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal from interest earned on the Offering Proceeds in
the trust account to fund income taxes payable, or upon the redemption by public shareholders of Class A ordinary shares in connection
with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, none of the funds held
in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the completion of the Company’s initial business combination or
the redemption of 100% of the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units and issued by the Company in the IPO if the Company
is unable to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of April 28, 2020 reflecting receipt of the Offering Proceeds has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit
99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
