Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On April 23, 2020,
the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-236974) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial
public offering (the “IPO”) of CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (the “Company”) was declared effective
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Company subsequently filed, on April 23, 2020, a registration statement
on Form S-1 (File No. 333-237817) pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which was effective immediately
upon filing. On April 28, 2020 the Company consummated the IPO of 41,400,000 units (the “Units”), which includes the
exercise in full of the underwriter’s option to purchase an additional 5,400,000 Units at the initial public offering price
to cover over-allotments. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class A Ordinary
Shares”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”), each whole Public Warrant entitling
the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $414,000,000. Further, in connection with the IPO, the Company entered into
the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:

 


·an Underwriting Agreement, dated April 23, 2020, between the Company and Goldman Sachs & Co.
LLC and BofA Securities, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, which contains customary representations
and warranties and indemnification of the underwriters by the Company;

 


·a Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated April 23, 2020, between the Company and
CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), pursuant to which the Sponsor purchased 10,280,000 private
placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant
(the “Private Placement Warrants” and, together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”);

 


·a Warrant Agreement, dated April 28, 2020, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, as warrant agent (the “Warrant Agreement”), which sets forth the expiration and exercise price of and
procedure for exercising the Warrants; certain adjustment features of the terms of exercise; provisions relating to redemption
and cashless exercise of the Warrants; certain registration rights of the holders of Warrants; provision for amendments to the
Warrant Agreement; and indemnification of the warrant agent by the Company under the agreement;

 


·an Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated April 28, 2020, between the Company and Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee, which establishes the trust account that will hold the net proceeds of the IPO
and certain of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and sets forth the responsibilities of the trustee;
the procedures for withdrawal and direction of funds from the trust account; and indemnification of the trustee by the Company
under the agreement;

 


·a Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated April 28, 2020, between the Company, the
Sponsor and certain equityholders of the Company, which provides for customary demand and piggy-back registration rights for the
Sponsor, and customary piggy-back registration rights for such other equityholders, as well as certain transfer restrictions applicable
to the Sponsor with respect to the Company’s securities, and, upon consummation of our initial business combination, the
right of the Sponsor to nominate three individuals for election to the Company’s board of directors;

 


·a Letter Agreement, dated April 28, 2020, by and between the Company, the Sponsor and each of the
executive officers and directors of the Company, pursuant to which the Sponsor and each executive officer and director of the Company
has agreed to vote any Class A Ordinary Shares held by him or her in favor of the Company’s initial business combination;
to facilitate the liquidation and winding up of the Company if an initial business combination is not consummated within 24 months;
to certain transfer restrictions with respect to the Company’s securities; to certain indemnification obligations of the
Sponsor; and pursuant to which the Company has agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination
without the prior consent of the Sponsor; and

 




    2 
     
    

 


·an Administrative Services Agreement, dated April 28, 2020, by and between the Company and the
Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to make available office space and certain administrative and support services,
as may be required by the Company from time to time, for $20,000 per month until the Company’s initial business combination
or liquidation.

 

The above descriptions
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreement, each of which is incorporated by reference
herein and filed herewith as Exhibits 1.1, 10.1, 4.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5, respectively.

 


Item 3.02.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneous with the
consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale of the Units, the Company consummated the private placement of 10,280,000 Private
Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $10,280,000 (the “Private
Placement”). The Private Placement Warrants, which were purchased by the Sponsor, are substantially similar to the Public
Warrants, except that if held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, they (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless
basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption under certain redemption scenarios and (iii) subject to certain limited
exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of the Company’s initial business
combination. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private
Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company under all redemption scenarios and exercisable by holders on the same basis
as the Public Warrants. The Private Placement Warrants have been issued pursuant to, and are governed by the Warrant Agreement.

 


Item 5.03.Amendments to Memorandum and Articles of Association.

 

On April 23, 2020 and
in connection with the IPO, the Company adopted its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. The Amended and
Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
