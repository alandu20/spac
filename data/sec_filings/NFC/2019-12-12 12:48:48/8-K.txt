“believes,” “seeks,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “future,”
“propose” and variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions)
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance,
conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors,
many of which are outside the Company’s or UFH’s control, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially
from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the Company’s
and UFH’s expectations with respect to the timing of the Extraordinary Meeting, the satisfaction of the closing conditions
of the Business Combination and the timing of the completion of the Business Combination. Important factors, among others, that
may affect actual results or outcomes include the inability to complete the Business Combination (including due to the failure
to receive required shareholder approvals, or the failure of other closing conditions); the inability to recognize the anticipated
benefits of the proposed Business Combination; the inability to meet the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange; costs
related to the Business Combination; UFH’s ability to manage growth; UFH’s ability to execute its business plan and
meet its projections; UFH’s ability to identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions; rising costs adversely affecting
UFH’s profitability; potential litigation involving the Company or UFH, or after the closing, the post-business combination
company; general economic and market conditions impacting demand for UFH’s services, and in particular economic and market
conditions in the Chinese healthcare industry and changes in the rules and regulations that apply to such business, including as
it relates to foreign investments in such businesses; and such other risks and uncertainties as are discussed in the definitive
proxy statement relating to the Business Combination, including those under “Risk Factors” therein, and in the Company’s
other filings with the SEC. None of the Company or UFH undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
