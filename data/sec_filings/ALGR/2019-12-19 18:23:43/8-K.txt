Item 8.01 Other Events.

 

In accordance
with Section 2.3(f) of the previously-announced Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among
Allegro Merger Corp. (“Allegro”), Allegro Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), TGIF Holdings, LLC (“TGIF”),
TGIF Midco, Inc. (“Midco”), and Rohit Manocha (solely in his capacity as the initial representative of the equityholders
of TGIF and Midco), the equityholders of TGIF have executed and delivered letters of transmittal which set forth each equityholder’s
desired mix of cash consideration and shares of Allegro common stock to be issued upon consummation of the merger of Midco with
and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 

Holders of approximately 86% of the outstanding
TGIF membership interests, including all of the TGIF membership interests owned by MFP Partners, L.P., which is led by Michael
F. Price, have elected to receive shares of Allegro common stock as consideration in the Merger and holders of approximately 14%
of the outstanding TGIF membership interests have elected to receive cash. In the aggregate, this stock election is well in excess
of the minimum required stock election of 40% to preserve the status of the Merger as a tax-free reorganization. Allegro’s
management believes that the stock elections exhibit confidence of the current TGIF equityholders in the TGIF business.
