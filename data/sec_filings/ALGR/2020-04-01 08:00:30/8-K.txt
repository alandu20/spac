Item
                                         1.02Termination
                                         of a Material Definitive Agreement

 

On
March 31, 2020, Allegro Merger Corp. (the “Company”) and TGIF Holdings, LLC (“Holdings”) mutually determined,
due to extraordinary market conditions and the failure to meet necessary closing conditions, to terminate the previously announced
Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”), dated as of November 8, 2019, by and among the Company, Holdings,
TGIF Midco, Inc. (“Midco”), Allegro Merger Sub, Inc., and Rohit Manocha, solely in his capacity as the representative
of the equityholders of Holdings and Midco.

 

As
previously disclosed, on March 26, 2020, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s amended
and restated certificate of incorporation (“Charter”) to extend the time by which the Company has to complete an initial
business combination from March 31, 2020 to April 30, 2020. However, in light of the termination of the Merger Agreement and due
to extraordinary market conditions, the Company determined on March 31, 2020 that it would not so amend its Charter.

 



Accordingly, pursuant to the Charter, on March
31, 2020, the Company’s corporate existence will cease except for the purposes of winding up its affairs and liquidating.
As soon as practicable, the Company will liquidate and distribute to the holders of shares of common stock issued in its initial
public offering their pro-rata portion of the funds held in the trust account established for the benefit of such stockholders,
which will be an amount equal to the aggregate amount on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest
earned on the trust account then held therein, less any interest to be released to the Company to pay its franchise and income
taxes and certain of the Company’s working capital and dissolution expenses. The Company’s warrants and rights will
expire with no value.
