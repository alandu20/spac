    Item 4.01
    Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant.

 

On June 23, 2020, Allegro Merger Corp, (the
“Company”) engaged Malone Bailey, LLP (“Malone”) as its principal accountant to review the
Company’s financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Malone replaced WithumSmith+Brown, PC (“Withum”),
who was dismissed as the Company’s principal accountant on the same date. The decision to change principal accountants was
approved by the Company’s audit committee.

 

Withum’s report on the financial statements
for each of the past two fiscal years contained an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern as described in the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for each such fiscal year. Withum’s
report for each of the past two fiscal years did not otherwise contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not
otherwise qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.

 

During the Company’s two most recent
fiscal years and the subsequent interim period preceding the change in principal accountants, the Company did not have any disagreements
with Withum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,
which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Withum, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter
of the disagreement in connection with its report. No “reportable events” (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K) occurred within the Company’s two most recent fiscal years or during the subsequent interim period preceding the change
in principal accountants.

 

During the Company’s two most recent
fiscal years and the subsequent interim period preceding the change in principal accountants, the Company did not consult Malone
regarding: either the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type
of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements; or any matter that was either the subject
of a disagreement (as described above) or a “reportable event” (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

 

The Company provided Withum with a copy of
the disclosures made pursuant to this Item 4.01 prior to the filing of this Current Report, and requested Withum to furnish a letter
addressed to the Commission, stating whether it agrees with such disclosures, and, if not, stating the respects in which it does
not agree. The letter furnished by Withum in response to such request is attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 16.
