                                         of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement

Item
                          5.07.Submission
                                         of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

 

On
January 3, 2020, Allegro Merger Corp. (the “Company”) held a special meeting of its shareholders (the “Meeting”).
At the Meeting, the Company’s shareholders considered a proposal to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (the “charter”) to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate its initial business combination
(the “Extension”) from January 6, 2020 to March 31, 2020 (the “Extended Date”). The proposal was approved
by the Company’s shareholders. The following is a tabulation of the votes with respect to the proposal:

 



    For  
    Against  
    Abstain  
    Broker Non-Votes 

     15,171,970  
     4,000  
     0  
     0 




 

In
connection with this vote, the holders of 3,782,869 shares of common stock of the Company exercised their right to convert their
shares into cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.22 per share, for an aggregate conversion amount of approximately
$38.7 million.

 

Following
the Meeting, the Company filed the amendment to the charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

 

Additionally,
in connection with the approval of the Extension, on January 3, 2020, certain individuals and entities (the “Contributors”)
that participated in the private placement of units that occurred simultaneously with the Company’s initial public offering
contributed to the Company an aggregate amount of $781,699.17, representing contributions covering a prorated amount of $0.02
per unconverted public share for the partial month of January 2020 and $0.025 per unconverted public share for each of February
2020 and March 2020 (each, a “Contribution”).

 

Following
the Meeting and filing of the amendment to the charter, the Company deposited $223,342.62, the Contribution for January 2020,
into the trust account established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. The Company will deposit the
second Contribution on or before January 31, 2020, and will deposit the third Contribution on or before February 29, 2020, in
each case, to the same trust account; provided that any such additional Contribution will only be made if the previously announced
merger agreement with TGI Fridays is still then in effect, or, if such agreement is earlier terminated, the Board of Directors
of the Company by majority vote determines to require such additional Contribution. If the Board of Directors determines not to
require such additional Contribution, the Company will proceed to liquidate its assets and distribute the remaining amounts in
the trust account to the then holders of public shares.

 

The
Contributions will not bear any interest and will be repayable by the Company to the Contributors upon consummation of an initial
business combination. The Contributions will be forgiven if the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination
except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company’s trust account.
