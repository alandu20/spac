 Item 8.01 Other Events 
General Meeting Dial-in Information 
As previously announced, the extraordinary general meeting (the General Meeting) of the shareholders of Leo Holdings Corp.
(Leo) will be held on Tuesday, July 14, 2020 at 9:00 a.m., New York City Time. On July 6, 2020, Leo issued a press release announcing that, due to the public health and safety concerns related to the
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and recommendations and orders from federal and New York authorities, the General Meeting will be held remotely by teleconference. The purpose of the General Meeting is to vote on certain proposals relating
to the previously announced Business Combination Agreement. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. 
The General Meeting will be accessible by dialing (833) 780-7941 (toll freeNorth America) or (469)
333-9522 (International). Shareholders will be able to ask questions to Leos management via the conference line.  All
information about the General Meeting, including the definitive proxy statement, is available at https://www.cstproxy.com/leoholdingscorp/2020. 
Additional Information  In
connection with the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement, dated April 23, 2020, by and among Leo, Digital Media Solutions LLC (DMS), and the other parties thereto (the
Business Combination Agreement), Leo has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the Registration Statement) and mailed a definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to its shareholders. This communication is
not a substitute for the Registration Statement, the definitive proxy statement/prospectus or any other document that Leo will send to its shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the
Business Combination). Investors and security holders of Leo are advised to read the definitive proxy statement/prospectus in connection with Leos solicitation of proxies for its extraordinary general
meeting of shareholders to be held to approve the Business Combination (and related matters) because the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the Business Combination and the parties to the Business
Combination. The definitive proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to shareholders of Leo as of June 24, 2020, the record date established for voting on the Business Combination. Shareholders are also be able to obtain copies of the
definitive proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, at the SECs website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: Leo Holdings Corp., 21 Grosvenor Place, London SW1X 7HF, United Kingdom. 
Participants in the Solicitation 
Leo and its directors, executive officers, other members of management, and employees, under SEC rules, may be deemed to be participants in the
solicitation of proxies of Leos shareholders in connection with the Business Combination. Investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names and interests in the Business Combination of Leos
directors and officers in Leos filings with the SEC, including Leos Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on March 13, 2020, as well as in the
Registration Statement, which includes the definitive proxy statement/prospectus of Leo for the Business Combination. Shareholders can obtain copies of Leos filings with the SEC, without charge, at the SECs website at
www.sec.gov.  Forward-Looking Statements 
This communication includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Leos and DMSs actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future
events. Words such as expect, estimate, project, budget, forecast, anticipate, intend, plan, may, will, could,
should, believes, predicts, potential, continue, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, Leos and DMSs expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated 








 
financial impacts of the proposed Business Combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the Business Combination and the timing of the completion of the Business Combination. These
forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside Leos and DMSs control and are difficult to
predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Business Combination Agreement; (2) the outcome
of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Leo and DMS following the announcement of the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the proposed Business Combination,
including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of Leo or other conditions to closing in the Business Combination Agreement; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination
of the Business Combination Agreement or could otherwise cause the Business Combination to fail to close; (5) the amount of redemption requests made by Leos shareholders; (6) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the
post-business combination companys common stock on the New York Stock Exchange following the proposed Business Combination; (7) the risk that the proposed Business Combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the
announcement and consummation of the proposed Business Combination; (8) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the
combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (9) costs related to the proposed Business Combination; (10) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (11) the possibility that DMS or the combined
company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement relating to the proposed Business Combination, including those
under Risk Factors in the Registration Statement, and in Leos other filings with the SEC. Some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by the COVID-19 outbreak and there may be
additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. Leo cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Leo cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Leo does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations
or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.  No Offer or Solicitation 
This communication is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, subscribe
for or buy any securities or the solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction pursuant to the Business Combination or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer or securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law.
No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act and otherwise in accordance with applicable law.
