Item 8.01
 Other Events 
As previously disclosed, on April 23, 2020, Digital Media Solutions Holdings, LLC (DMS) and Leo Holdings Corp.
(Leo) announced that Leo and DMS entered into a business combination agreement (the Business Combination Agreement). 
On June 23, 2020, the Company received a letter (the Shareholder Letter) from a purported shareholder of Leo claiming
certain allegedly material omissions in the preliminary proxy statement filed on June 22, 2020 by Leo (the Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the
Business Combination).  While Leo believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with
applicable law, in order to moot the plaintiffs disclosure claims in the Shareholder Letter, to avoid nuisance, cost and distraction, and to preclude any efforts to delay the closing of the Business Combination, Leo has determined to
voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the Supplemental Disclosures). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or
materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, Leo specifically denies all allegations in the Shareholder Letter that any additional disclosure was or is required. Leo believes the Shareholder Letter
is without merit.  Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement 
The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page
references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement. 
The following disclosure replaces the first paragraph on page 120 of the Proxy Statement under the heading Background of the
Business Combination.  In the process that led to identifying DMS as an attractive investment opportunity, Leos
management team evaluated over 65 potential business combination targets, entered into non-disclosure agreements with approximately 32 potential business combination targets (other than DMS), and submitted non-binding indications of interest or letters of intent with respect to 15 potential business combination targets (other than DMS).
Such non-disclosure agreements contained customary terms for a special purpose acquisition company and a private company target, including confidentiality provisions
and use restrictions for information provided by the target and exceptions to such provisions. The following disclosure replaces
the first paragraph on page 123 of the Proxy Statement under the heading Background of the Business Combination.  From
and after March 27, 2020, the parties continued to negotiate the Business Combination Agreement and the related ancillary agreements. In the context of negotiating the Director Nomination Agreement, the parties agreed that Lyndon Lea and
Robert Darwent would remain on the board of directors of New DMS and that Mary Minnick would be appointed as the Independent Stockholder Director (as defined in the Director Nomination Agreement). Each of Lyndon Lea, Robert Darwent and Mary Minnick
are current directors of Leo. The remainder of the Leo Board and Leos officers will no longer serve as directors or officers, and will not otherwise be employees of New DMS, upon consummation of the Business Combination. 
The following disclosure replaces the first paragraph on page 129 of the Proxy Statement under the heading Background of the
Business Combination.  Based on the financial analysis of DMS generally used to approve the transaction (including the
review of DMSs historical financial results, outlook, financial plan and debt structure, as well as valuations and trading of publicly traded companies and valuations of precedent merger and acquisition targets in similar and adjacent sectors,
and the review of financial due diligence materials prepared by professional advisors, including quality of earnings reports and tax due diligence reports), the Leo board of directors determined that this requirement was met.








 Additional Information 
In connection with the Business Combination, Leo has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the Registration Statement) and mailed a definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to its shareholders.
This communication is not a substitute for the Registration Statement, the definitive proxy statement/prospectus or any other document that Leo will send to its shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business
Combination Agreement (the Business Combination). Investors and security holders of Leo are advised to read the definitive proxy statement/prospectus in connection with Leos solicitation of proxies for its
extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held to approve the Business Combination (and related matters) because the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the Business Combination and the parties to the
Business Combination. The definitive proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to shareholders of Leo as of June 24, 2020, the record date established for voting on the Business Combination. Shareholders are also be able to obtain copies
of the definitive proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, at the SECs website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: Leo Holdings Corp., 21 Grosvenor Place, London SW1X 7HF, United Kingdom. 
Participants in the Solicitation 
Leo and its directors, executive officers, other members of management, and employees, under SEC rules, may be deemed to be participants in the
solicitation of proxies of Leos shareholders in connection with the Business Combination. Investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names and interests in the Business Combination of
Leos directors and officers in Leos filings with the SEC, including Leos Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on March 13, 2020, as well as in the Registration Statement, which includes the proxy statement of Leo for the Business Combination. Shareholders can
obtain copies of Leos filings with the SEC, without charge, at the SECs website at www.sec.gov.  Forward-Looking Statements 
This communication includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Leos and DMSs actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future
events. Words such as expect, estimate, project, budget, forecast, anticipate, intend, plan, may, will, could,
should, believes, predicts, potential, continue, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, Leos and DMSs expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the proposed Business Combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the Business Combination and the timing of
the completion of the Business Combination. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside Leos
and DMSs control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Business
Combination Agreement; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Leo and DMS following the announcement of the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to
complete the proposed Business Combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of Leo or other conditions to closing in the Business Combination Agreement; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other
circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Business Combination Agreement or could otherwise cause the Business Combination to fail to close; (5) the amount of redemption requests made by Leos shareholders; (6) the
inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the post-business combination companys common stock on the New York Stock Exchange following the proposed Business Combination; (7) the risk that the proposed Business Combination
disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the proposed Business Combination; (8) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed Business Combination, which may be affected by,
among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (9) costs related to the proposed Business Combination; (10) changes in applicable laws or regulations;
(11) the possibility that DMS or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement relating to
the proposed Business Combination, including those under Risk Factors in the Registration Statement, and in Leos other filings with the SEC. Some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be
amplified by the COVID-19 outbreak and there may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks.
Leo cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Leo cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Leo does not undertake or accept any obligation or
undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act and otherwise in accordance with applicable law.
