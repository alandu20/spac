 Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders. 
Effective July 15, 2020, Leo Holdings Corp. changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands (Leo Cayman) to
the State of Delaware (the Domestication). In connection with the Domestication, Leo changed its name to Digital Media Solutions, Inc., which we refer to herein as New DMS. Leo discontinued its existence as a
Cayman Islands exempted company as provided under the Cayman Islands Companies Law (2020 Revision) and, pursuant to Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL), continued its existence under the
DGCL as a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware.  In connection with the Domestication, each issued and outstanding
Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of Leo (the Class A ordinary shares) and each issued and outstanding Class B ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of Leo (the Class B ordinary
shares) has become, by operation of law, one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of New DMS (the New DMS Class A Common Stock), as described in Item 8.01 below. 
Upon effectiveness of the Domestication, New DMSs CUSIP numbers relating to its Class A common stock and warrants changed to 25401G
106 and 25401G 114, respectively. The New DMS Class A Common Stock and New DMSs warrants will be listed on the NYSE under the symbols DMS and DMS WS, respectively. 
The rights of holders of New DMSs common stock are now governed by its Delaware certificate of incorporation (the Charter),
its Delaware bylaws (the Bylaws) and the DGCL, which contain provisions that differ in certain respects from shareholders rights under the laws of the Cayman Islands and Leos Memorandum and Articles of Association, which were
in effect prior to the Domestication. The general effect of the changes to the rights of New DMSs stockholders are described under the sections entitled Description of New DMS Securities, U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations and Comparison of Corporate Governance and Shareholder Rights in Leos definitive proxy statement/prospectus, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) on
June 24, 2020 (the Final Proxy Statement/Prospectus) and formed part of Leos registration statement on Form S-4, which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
May 11, 202020 (Registration No. 333-238180).  The sections of the Final Proxy
Statement/Prospectus listed above are hereby incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K. Furthermore, copies of the Charter and Bylaws are included as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to
this Current Report on Form 8-K and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.  Item 5.03 Amendments to
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  The disclosure set forth in Item 3.03 above is hereby incorporated into
this Item 5.03 by reference.  Item 8.01 Other Events. 
In accordance with Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act), the shares of common stock and warrants of New DMS, as the successor to Leo, are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. 
In connection with the Domestication, (1) the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares converted automatically by operation of
law, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of New DMS Class A Common Stock; (2) the issued and outstanding redeemable warrants that were registered pursuant to
the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (333-222599) of Leo became automatically redeemable warrants to acquire shares of New DMS Class A Common Stock (no other
changes were made to the terms of any issued and outstanding public warrants of Leo as a result of the Domestication); (3) each issued and outstanding unit of Leo that has not been previously separated into the underlying Class A ordinary share
and underlying warrant upon the request of the holder thereof, was cancelled and entitled the holder thereof to one share of New DMS Class A Common Stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant to acquire
one share of New DMS Class A Common Stock; (4) each issued and outstanding Class B ordinary share converted automatically by operation of law, on a
one-for-one basis without giving effect to any rights of adjustment or other anti-dilution protections, into shares of New DMS Class A Common Stock; and
(5) the issued and outstanding warrants of Leo issued in a private placement automatically became warrants to acquire shares of New DMS Class A Common Stock (no other changes were made to the terms of any issued and outstanding private
placement warrants of Leo as a result of the Domestication). 








 Consequently, each holder of a Class A ordinary share, Class B ordinary share or
warrant immediately prior to the Domestication now holds a share of Class A common stock or warrant representing the same proportional equity interest in New DMS as that shareholder held in Leo and representing the same class of security. 
It is not necessary for stockholders to exchange their existing Leo share certificates for new stock certificates of New DMS. Holders of
uncertificated shares of Leo immediately prior to the Domestication continued as holders of uncertificated common stock of New DMS upon effectiveness of the Domestication.
