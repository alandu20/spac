Item
3.02Unregistered
                                         Sales of Equity Securities

 

On
March 4, 2019, simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of Tortoise Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) and pursuant to a Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement dated February 27, 2019
by and between the Company and Tortoise Borrower LLC (“Tortoise Borrower”), the Company completed the private
sale of 6,660,183 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement
Warrant to Tortoise Borrower, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,660,183.40. The Private Placement Warrants are identical
to the warrants sold as part of the Units (as defined below) in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable
for cash by the Company and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by Tortoise Borrower or its permitted
transferees. Tortoise Borrower has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain
permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The issuance of
the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).

Item
8.01Other
                                         Events.

 

On
March 4, 2019, the Company completed its IPO of 23,300,917 units (the “Units”), including 800,917 Units that
were issued pursuant to the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option. The Units were issued pursuant
to an underwriting agreement, dated February 27, 2019, among the Company, on the one hand, and Barclays Capital Inc., Goldman
Sachs & Co. LLC and UBS Securities LLC, on the other hand, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. Each
Unit had an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share
(the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each such whole warrant,
a “Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price
of $11.50 per share.

 

Of
the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, $233,009,170, including $8,128,108.45 of deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, has been deposited into a U.S. based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in
the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds from the IPO
and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of (a) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination (including the release of funds to
pay any amounts due to any public stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights in connection therewith), (b) the
redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Certificate
of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Company’s
public shares if the Company does not complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or
(c) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete its business combination within 24
months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.

connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to
