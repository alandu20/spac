Item
7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

 

On April 19, 2019, Tortoise Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report
on Form 8-K, announcing that the holders of the Company’s units may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common
stock and warrants comprising the units commencing on April 22, 2019. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the
units and only whole warrants will trade. Those units not separated will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the
“NYSE”) under the symbol “SHLL.U,” and each of the shares of Class A common stock and warrants that
are separated will trade on the NYSE under the symbols “SHLL” and “SHLL WS,” respectively. Holders of the
units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent,
in order to separate the holders’ units into shares of Class A common stock and warrants.

 

In accordance
with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information presented herein under Item 7.01 and set forth in the attached press
release included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report is deemed to be “furnished” solely pursuant to Item 7.01 of this report
and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall such information or the
exhibit be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
