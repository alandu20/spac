On March 4, 2019, Tortoise Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) completed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 23,300,917 units
(the “Units”), including 800,917 Units that were issued pursuant to the underwriters’ partial exercise
of their over-allotment option. Each Unit had an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share of Class A common stock of
the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant
of the Company (each such whole warrant, a “Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share.

 

On March 4, 2019, simultaneously with the
closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 6,660,183 warrants (the
“Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant to Tortoise Borrower
LLC.

 

Of the net proceeds of the IPO and the
sale of the Private Placement Warrants, $233,009,170, including $8,128,108.45 of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions,
has been deposited into a U.S. based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee. An audited balance sheet as of March 4, 2019 of the Company reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon
the closing of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
