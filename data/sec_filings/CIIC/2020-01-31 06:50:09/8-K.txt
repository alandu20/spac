Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

Separate
Trading of Units, Class A Common Stock and Warrants

 

As
previously reported, on December 17, 2019, CIIG Merger Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public
offering (“IPO”) of an aggregate of 25,875,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of
one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”),
and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (the “Warrants” and each a “Warrant”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $258,750,000.

 

On
January 31, 2020, the Company issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form
8-K, announcing that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants comprising
the Units commencing on February 3, 2020. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under
the symbol “CIICU,” and the Class A Common Stock and Warrants that are separated will trade on The Nasdaq Capital
Market under the symbols “CIIC” and “CIICW,” respectively. No fractional warrants will be issued upon
separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to instruct their brokers to contact Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, to separate their Units into shares of Class A Common
Stock and Warrants.
