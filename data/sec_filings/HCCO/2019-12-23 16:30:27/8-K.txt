    Item
    8.01.
    Other
    Events.

 

On
December 17, 2019, Healthcare Merger Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 25,000,000 units (the “Units”), including 3,000,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’
over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class
A Common Stock”) and one half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000. 

 

On
December 17, 2019, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private
Placement”) of an aggregate of 700,000 Units (the “Private Placement Units”) to HCMC Sponsor LLC
(the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,000,000.

 

In
addition, the 6,325,000 shares of Class B common stock of the Company (the “Founder Shares”) held by the Sponsor
(prior to the exercise of the over-allotment) included an aggregate of up to 825,000 Founder Shares subject to forfeiture by the
Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full. Since the underwriters exercised
the over-allotment option in part, the Sponsor forfeited 75,000 Founder Shares on December 17, 2019. The Founder Shares forfeited
by the Sponsor were cancelled by the Company.

 

A
total of $250,000,000, comprised of $243,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $8,750,000 of the Underwriters’
deferred discount) and $7,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of December 17, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private
Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
