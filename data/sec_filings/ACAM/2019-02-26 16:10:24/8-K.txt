Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

  

On February 26, 2019,
Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 30,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“ Warrant ”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000,000. The Company has granted the
underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional Units.



 

In connection with
the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s
Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-229157) for the IPO, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “Commission”) on January 8, 2019 (as amended, the “Registration Statement”):

 



     
    ●
    An Underwriting Agreement, dated February 21, 2019, by and among the Company and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    A Warrant Agreement, dated February 21, 2019, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    A Letter Agreement, dated February 21, 2019, by and among the Company, its officers, its directors and the Company’s sponsor, Acamar Partners Sponsor I LLC (the “Sponsor”), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated February 21, 2019, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC, as trustee, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    A Registration Rights Agreement, dated February 21, 2019, by and between the Company and the Sponsor, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 



     
    ●
    An Administrative Support Agreement, dated February 21, 2019, by and between the Company, the Sponsor and Enso Advisory LLC, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.4 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

     
     
     

     
    ●
    A Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated February 21, 2019 (the “Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement”), by and between the Company and the Sponsor, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.5 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

  

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

  

Simultaneously with
the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of
an aggregate of 6,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private
Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $9,000,000. The Sponsor has committed to purchase
up to an additional 600,000 Private Placement Warrants if the Underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Units in
full. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor
has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until
30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable
for cash by the Company so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. No underwriting discounts or commissions
were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration
contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 




     
     
    

 

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

  

On February 21, 2019,
in connection with the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, effective the same day. The terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are set forth
in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.



 

Item 8.01. Other Events.

 

A total of $300,000,000,
comprised of $294,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $10,500,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount)
and $6,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee. Except with respect
to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held
in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s
initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Company’s public shares properly submitted in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance
or timing of its obligation to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of the IPO and (iii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete
its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.
