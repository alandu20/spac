Item 8.01.Other Events.


 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp., on February 26, 2019, the Company consummated its initial
public offering (“IPO”) of 30,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share
of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“ Class A Common Stock ”), and one-third
of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to
purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000,000. The Company had granted the underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”)
a 45-day option to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional Units (each an “Additional Unit”). On April 5, 2019,
the Underwriters exercised the option in part and on April 9, 2019 purchased an aggregate of 557,322 Additional Units, which were
sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Additional Unit, generating gross proceeds of $5,573,220.

 

As previously reported
on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, on February 26, 2019, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed
the private sale of an aggregate of 6,000,000 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) to Acamar Partners Sponsor
I LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds
to the Company of $9,000,000. On April 9, 2019, in connection with the sale of the Additional Units, the Company consummated a
private sale of an additional 74,310 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $111,465.

 

In addition, the 8,625,000
shares of Class B common stock of the Company (the “Founder Shares”) held by the Sponsor (prior to the exercise
of the option to purchase Additional Units) included an aggregate of up to 1,125,000 Founder Shares subject to forfeiture by the
Sponsor to the extent that the Underwriters’ option to purchase Additional Units was not fully exercised. Since the Underwriters
exercised the option to purchase Additional Units in part, the Sponsor forfeited 985,670 Founder Shares on April 9, 2019. The Founder
Shares forfeited by the Sponsor were cancelled by the Company.

 

A total of approximately
$305,573,220, (or $10.00 per Unit) comprised of approximately $296,461,756 of the proceeds from the IPO (including the Additional
Units) and $9,111,465 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee.  

 

An audited balance
sheet as of February 26, 2019 reflecting receipt of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement on February 26, 2019,
but not the proceeds from the sale of the Additional Units nor the private placement that closed on April 9, 2019, had been prepared
by the Company and previously filed on a Current Report on Form 8-K on March 4, 2019. The Company’s unaudited
pro forma balance sheet as of April 9, 2019, reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the Additional Units and the private
placement that closed on the same day is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 

On April 9, 2019, the
Company issued a press release announcing the consummation of the sale of the Additional Units, a copy of which is included as
Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
