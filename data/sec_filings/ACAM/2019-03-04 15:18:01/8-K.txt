Item 8.01.Other Events.


 

On February 26, 2019,
Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”)
of 30,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share ( “Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”),
with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units
were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000,000. The Company has granted the
underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional Units.

 

Simultaneously with
the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of
6,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Acamar Partners Sponsor I LLC (the “Sponsor”),
at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $9,000,000. The Sponsor
has committed to purchase up to an additional 600,000 Private Placement Warrants if the Underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional Units in full.

 

A total of $300,000,000,
comprised of $294,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $10,500,000 of the Underwriters’ deferred discount)
and $6,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of February 26, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been
issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
