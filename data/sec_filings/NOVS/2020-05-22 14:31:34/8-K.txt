Item 8.01.Other Events.





 

On May 19, 2020 Novus
Capital Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 10,000,000
of its units (“Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common
Stock”), and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder to purchase
one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of $100,000,000.

 

Simultaneously with
the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 3,250,000
Warrants (“Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $3,250,000,
to the Company’s initial stockholders and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EBC”), the sole book-running manager
of the IPO. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants, except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be
exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.
The purchasers of the Private Warrants have agreed (A) to vote the Common Stock underlying the Private Warrants (“Private
Shares”) in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to convert any Private Shares into the right to receive
cash from the trust account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the Company’s proposed initial business combination
or sell any Private Shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a proposed initial business combination and (C)
that such Private Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a business combination is not
consummated within the required time period. Additionally, the purchasers of Private Warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign
or sell any of the securities purchased in the Private Placement, including the underlying Common Stock (except to certain permitted
transferees), until consummation of the Company’s initial business combination.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of May 19, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the consummation of the
IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement is included as Exhibit
99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
