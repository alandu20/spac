    Item 3.02.  
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.



 

	The
information provided in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.

 


Item
                                         8.01.Other
                                         Events.

 

On
October 22, 2019, the Company consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”) of 20,000,000 of its units (“Units”),
including 2,500,000 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share,
$.0001 par value (“Ordinary Shares”), of the Company and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”),
with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an
offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000.

 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 6,250,000
warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total
proceeds of $6,250,000. The Private Placement Warrants were purchased by the Company’s sponsors, Union Group International
Holdings Limited and Union Acquisition Associates II, LLC. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included
in the Units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless
basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial stockholders or their permitted transferees. The purchasers
of the Private Placement Warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants or Ordinary
Shares underlying the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s
initial business combination.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of October 22, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the
consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement
is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
