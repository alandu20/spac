On February 26, 2020, Mudrick Capital Acquisition

Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Current Report includes
 “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “forecast,”
 “intend,” “seek,” “target,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,”
 “estimate,” “plan,” “outlook,” and “project” and other similar expressions that
predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Such forward-looking statements may
include estimated financial information, including with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other
aspects of the businesses of the Company, Seller or the combined company after completion of the business combination, and are
based on current expectations that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from expectations expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include,
but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could result in the proposed business
combination not being completed at all or on the expected timeline, including as a result of the termination of the Purchase Agreement
or the failure to obtain approval of the Company’s stockholders or other conditions to closing in the Purchase Agreement;
(2) the ability to meet applicable NASDAQ listing standards; (3) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts current
plans and operations of Seller’s business as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions described
herein; (4) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, which may be affected by, among
other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with
customers and suppliers and retain its management and key employees; (5) costs related to the proposed business combination; (6)
changes in applicable laws or regulations; (7) the possibility that Seller’s business may be adversely affected by other
economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (8) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the definitive
version of the registration statement of the Company filed on February 14, 2020 in connection with the proposed business combination
and the joint proxy statement/prospectus contained therein (as amended or supplemented, the “Registration Statement”),
including those under “Risk Factors” therein, and other documents filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by the Company. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date made. The Company and Seller undertake no commitment to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Anyone using the presentation does so at their own risk and no responsibility
is accepted for any losses which may result from such use directly or indirectly. Investors should carry out their own due diligence
in connection with the assumptions contained herein. The forward-looking statements in this current report speak as of the date
of its filing. Although the Company may from time to time voluntarily update its prior forward-looking statements, it disclaims
any commitment to do so whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise except as required
by applicable securities laws.

in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under
the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. This Current Report relates to a proposed business combination between the Company
and Seller.

 

Additional Information About the Business Combination

 

In connection with the proposed
business combination between the Company and Seller, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
on February 14, 2020, the Registration Statement on Form S-4 and will mail a definitive Registration Statement and other relevant
documentation to the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s stockholders and other interested persons, including Seller’s
stockholders, are advised to read, when available, the preliminary Registration Statement and the amendments thereto that are or
will be filed with the SEC and the definitive Registration Statement and documents incorporated by reference therein filed with
the SEC and mailed to such stockholders as these materials will contain important information about the Company, Seller and the
proposed business combination. The definitive Registration Statement will be mailed to the Company’s stockholders and to
Seller’s stockholders, in each case, as of the applicable record date to be established for voting on the proposed business
combination, when it becomes available.

Participants in the Solicitation

 

The Company and its directors,
executive officers and other members of its management and employees and Seller and its directors and management may be deemed
to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the Company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed business
combination. Stockholders are urged to carefully read the Registration Statement because it contains important information about
the Company, Seller and the proposed business combination. The Registration Statement also contains information regarding the persons
who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed participants in the solicitation of the Company’s stockholders in connection
with the proposed business combination, including information about the Company’s directors and executive officers, which
