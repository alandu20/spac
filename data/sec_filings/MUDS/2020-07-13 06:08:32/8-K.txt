Item 4.01.Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant.

  



    (a)
    Dismissal of independent registered public accounting firm

 

On July 8, 2020, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
(the “Audit Committee”) of Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation (the “Company”), formerly known as Mudrick
Capital Acquisition Corporation, approved the dismissal of WithumSmith+Brown, PC (“Withum”) as the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm. The reports of Withum on the financial statements as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018 of the Company did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified
or modified as to uncertainties, audit scope or accounting principles, except that Withum’s report for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018 included an explanatory paragraph indicating that the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent
dissolution raised a substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

 

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the subsequent
interim period through July 8, 2020, there were no disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) between the
Company and Withum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure,
which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Withum, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter
of the disagreements in its report on the Company’s financial statements for such years. During the years ended December
31, 2019 and 2018 and the subsequent interim period through July 8, 2020, there were no “reportable events” (as defined
in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

The Company has provided Withum with a copy of the
foregoing disclosures and has requested that Withum furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange
Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the Company set forth above. A copy of Withum’s letter
will be filed by amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 



    (b)
    Engagement of new independent registered public accounting firm

 

On July 8, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement
of Plante & Moran PLLC (“Plante Moran”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. Plante Moran was the independent registered public accounting firm for Hycroft Mining
Corporation prior to the acquisition of substantially all of its assets by the Company in a business combination that was consummated
on May 29, 2020 and in which the seller, Hycroft Mining Corporation, was treated for accounting purposes as the acquiror in the
transaction and the financial statements of Hycroft Mining Corporation became the financial statements of the Company. During the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the subsequent period through July 8, 2020, neither the Company nor anyone on the Company’s
behalf consulted with Plante Moran regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction (either completed
or proposed), the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, or any matter that was either the subject
of a “disagreement,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, or a “reportable event,” as defined
in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
