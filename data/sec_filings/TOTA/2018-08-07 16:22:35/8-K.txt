Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On August 1, 2018, the registration statement
(File No. 333-226072) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering (“IPO”) of
Tottenham Acquisition I Limited (the “Company”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In
connection therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:

 




·An Underwriting Agreement, dated August 1, 2018, by and between the Company and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”),
as representative of the underwriters;


·A Warrant Agreement, dated August 1, 2018, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;


·A Rights Agreement, dated August 1, 2018, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;


·Letter Agreements, dated August 1, 2018, by and between the Company and each of the initial shareholders, officers and directors
of the Company;


·An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated August 1, 2018, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company;


·A Stock Escrow Agreement, dated August 1, 2018, by and among the Company, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and
each of the initial shareholders of the Company; and


·A Registration Rights Agreement, dated August 1, 2018, by and among the Company and the initial shareholders of the Company.





 



On August 6, 2018, the Company consummated
the IPO of 4,600,000 units (the “Units”), which includes the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment
option of 600,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”)
entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive
one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $46,000,000. In addition, the Company sold to Chardan, for $100, an option
to purchase up to 220,000 units exercisable at $11.50 per unit pursuant to the Unit Purchase Option agreement as set forth in
Exhibit 4.3, commencing on the later of the consummation of a business combination and six months from the effective date of the
Registration Statement.

 

As of August 6, 2018, a total of $46,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for
the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. An audited balance sheet as of August 6, 2018 reflecting receipt of the
proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement will be filed within 4 days of the consummation of the IPO.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the
IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with certain of its initial shareholders of
215,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,150,000.

 



The Private Units are identical to the
Units sold in the IPO except that the warrants included in the Private Units will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a
cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally,
because the Private Units were issued in a private transaction, the initial purchasers and their permitted transferees will be
allowed to exercise the warrants included in the Private Units for cash even if a registration statement covering the ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered ordinary shares. Additionally, such initial
purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances,
as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such Initial
Purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units.

 

The Private Units were issued pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
