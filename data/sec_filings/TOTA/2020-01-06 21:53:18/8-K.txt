Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued
Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

 

On January 3, 2020, Tottenham
Acquisition I Limited (the “Company”) received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
(“Nasdaq”), which stated that the Company no longer complies with Nasdaq’s continued listing rules due to the
Company not having held an annual meeting within 12 months of the Company’s fiscal year end, as required pursuant to rule
5620(a). In accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(2)(G), the Company has 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance and,
if Nasdaq accepts the plan, Nasdaq can grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the fiscal year end, or until
June 29, 2020, to regain compliance. The Company plans to submit a compliance plan within the specified period.
