Item 8.01. Other Events

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K dated August 7, 2018, Tottenham Acquisition I Limited (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of 4,600,000 units (the “Units”), which included the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment
option of 600,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”)
entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive
one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $46,000,000. In addition, the Company sold to Chardan, for $100, an option
to purchase up to 220,000 units exercisable at $11.50 per unit, commencing on the later of the consummation of a business combination
and six months from the effective date of the Registration Statement.

 

As of August 6, 2018, a total of $46,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the private placement consummated simultaneously with the closing of the IPO were deposited
in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.

2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the private placement is included with this report as
