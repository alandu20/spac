Item 7.01
 Regulation FD Disclosure. 
On January 7, 2020, Leisure Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (LACQ) furnished an investor presentation
relating to its previously announced business combination (the Business Combination) with GTWY Holdings Limited (GTWY), the holding company for Gateway Casinos & Entertainment Limited (together with
affiliates, Gateway or the Company). Updated presentations were furnished on January 27, 2020 and February 11, 2020. 
LACQ is furnishing an updated form of investor presentation that is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. LACQ may
use such presentation in meetings with certain of its stockholders, as well as other persons who might be interested in purchasing securities in connection with the proposed Business Combination. 
The information set forth in this Item 7.01, including the exhibit attached hereto, is intended to be furnished and shall not be deemed
filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in
any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. 
Additional Information  In connection
with the Business Combination, LACQ has filed a preliminary proxy statement / prospectus and will file a definitive proxy statement / prospectus with the SEC and will mail a definitive proxy statement / prospectus and other relevant documents to its
stockholders. In addition, a Registration Statement on Form F-4 was filed with the SEC by the Company that includes the preliminary proxy statement / prospectus and will be utilized for the
registration of the securities to be issued in the Business Combination. Investors and security holders of LACQ are advised to read the preliminary proxy statement, the prospectus, amendments thereto, and, when available, the definitive proxy
statement / prospectus in connection with LACQs solicitation of proxies for its stockholders meeting to be held to approve the Business Combination because the proxy statement / prospectus will contain important information about the
Business Combination and the parties to it. The definitive proxy statement / prospectus will be mailed to stockholders of LACQ as of a record date to be established for voting on the Business Combination. Stockholders will also be able to obtain
copies of the proxy statement / prospectus, without charge, once available, at the SECs website at www.sec.gov or by directing a written request to Leisure Acquisition Corp., 250 West 57th Street, Suite 2223, New York, New York
10017.  Some of the Companys financial information and data contained herein and in the exhibit hereto does not conform to SEC
Regulation S-X in that it includes certain financial information identified therein that is not derived in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Accordingly,
such information and data may be adjusted and presented differently in LACQs proxy statement to solicit stockholder approval of the proposed transaction. LACQ and the Company believe that the presentation of such
non-IFRS measures are useful measures of performance and the Company uses such measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons on a consistent basis from period to period, to provide a more
complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. 








 The financial projections in this report and the exhibit hereto are forward-looking
statements that are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond LACQs and the Companys control. While all projections are necessarily speculative, LACQ and the
Company believe that the preparation of prospective financial information involves increasingly higher levels of uncertainty the further out the projection extends from the date of preparation. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected
results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the projections. The inclusion
of projections in this report and the exhibit hereto should not be regarded as an indication that LACQ and the Company, or their representatives, considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events. 
Participants in the Solicitation  LACQ,
the Company, and their respective directors, executive officers and other members of their management and employees, under SEC rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of LACQs stockholders in connection with the
Business Combination. Information regarding the participants is available in the preliminary proxy statement / prospectus filed by LACQ with the SEC on January 31, 2020. Additional information regarding the participants in the proxy
solicitation and a description of their direct and indirect interests is contained in the preliminary proxy statement, which can be obtained free of charge from the sources indicated above. 
Non-Solicitation 
This report and the exhibit hereto shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there
be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. 
Forward-Looking Statements  This report
and the exhibit hereto include forward-looking statements. The actual results or events may differ from the expectations and estimates contained herein and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as
predictions of future events. Words such as expect, estimate, project, budget, forecast, anticipate, intend, plan, may, will,
could, should, believes, predicts, potential, continue, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Neither LACQ nor the Company undertake
any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Important factors that may affect certain estimates or expectations expressed herein
include, among others, the possibility that the proposed transaction does not close, including due to the failure to receive required security holder approvals, or the failure of other closing conditions. 
This report and the exhibit hereto are not intended to be all-inclusive or to contain all the
information that a person may desire in considering an investment in LACQ and is not intended to form the basis of any investment decision in LACQ. 








 Additional information concerning the proposed Business Combination, including relevant risk
factors, are and will be contained in LACQs and the Companys filings with the SEC. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning LACQ and the Company, the proposed Business Combination or other matters and
attributable to LACQ and the Company or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Neither LACQ nor the Company undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in their expectations or any change in
events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by applicable law.
