 Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
As previously disclosed, on December 27, 2019, Leisure Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (LACQ), entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), by and among LACQ, GTWY Holdings Limited, a Canadian corporation (the Company), and GTWY Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub), relating to a proposed business combination transaction between LACQ and the Company (the Business Combination). Simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
LACQ, HG Vora Special Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd., the Sponsors (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and certain of their affiliates (collectively, the Supporting Parties) entered into a Transaction Support Agreement with the
Company (the Support Agreement). On January 30, 2020, LACQ, the Company and the Supporting Parties entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Transaction Support Agreement (the Amendment) in order to replace
the form of warrant agreement attached thereto and fix a typographical error.  A copy of the Amendment is filed with this Current Report
on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. 
Additional Information  In connection
with the Business Combination, LACQ has filed a preliminary proxy statement / prospectus and will file a definitive proxy statement / prospectus with the SEC and will mail a definitive proxy statement / prospectus and other relevant documents to its
stockholders. In addition, a Registration Statement on Form F-4 was filed with the SEC by the Company that includes the preliminary proxy statement / prospectus and will be utilized for the registration of the
securities to be issued in the Business Combination. Investors and security holders of LACQ are advised to read the preliminary proxy statement, the prospectus, amendments thereto, and, when available, the definitive proxy statement /
prospectus in connection with LACQs solicitation of proxies for its stockholders meeting to be held to approve the Business Combination because the proxy statement / prospectus will contain important information about the Business
Combination and the parties to it. The definitive proxy statement / prospectus will be mailed to stockholders of LACQ as of a record date to be established for voting on the Business Combination. Stockholders will also be able to obtain copies of
the proxy statement / prospectus, without charge, once available, at the SECs website at www.sec.gov or by directing a written request to Leisure Acquisition Corp., 250 West
57th Street, Suite 2223, New York, New York 10017.  Participants in the Solicitation 
LACQ, the Company, and their respective directors, executive officers and other members of their management and employees, under SEC rules, may
be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of LACQs stockholders in connection with the Business Combination. Information regarding the participants is available in the preliminary proxy statement / prospectus filed by
LACQ with the SEC on January 31, 2020. Additional information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation and a description of their direct and indirect interests is contained in the preliminary proxy statement, which can be obtained
free of charge from the sources indicated above. 








 Non-Solicitation 
This report and the exhibit hereto shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there
be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. 
Forward-Looking Statements This report
and the exhibit hereto include forward-looking statements. The actual results or events may differ from the expectations and estimates contained herein and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as
predictions of future events. Words such as expect, estimate, project, budget, forecast, anticipate, intend, plan, may, will,

any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Important factors that may affect certain estimates or expectations expressed herein
include, among others, the possibility that the proposed Business Combination does not close, including due to the failure to receive required security holder approvals, or the failure of other closing conditions. 
This report and the exhibit hereto are not intended to be all-inclusive or to contain all the
information that a person may desire in considering an investment in LACQ and is not intended to form the basis of any investment decision in LACQ. 
Additional information concerning the transaction, including relevant risk factors, are contained in LACQs and the Companys
filings with the sec. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning LACQ and the Company, the proposed business combination or other matters and attributable to LACQ and the Company or any person acting on their behalf are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Neither LACQ nor the Company undertake or accept
