SOME
OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND DATA CONTAINED HEREIN AND IN THE EXHIBIT HERETO DOES NOT CONFORM TO SEC REGULATION
S-X IN THAT IT INCLUDES CERTAIN FINANCIAL INFORMATION IDENTIFIED THEREIN THAT IS NOT DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS (“IFRS”). ACCORDINGLY, SUCH INFORMATION AND DATA MAY BE ADJUSTED AND PRESENTED DIFFERENTLY IN
LACQ’S PROXY STATEMENT TO SOLICIT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. LACQ AND THE COMPANY BELIEVE THAT THE
PRESENTATION OF SUCH NON-IFRS MEASURES ARE USEFUL MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE AND THE COMPANY USES SUCH MEASURES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE
OPERATING PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF FACTORS
AND TRENDS AFFECTING ITS BUSINESS, TO PREPARE ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGETS AND FORECASTS AND TO DETERMINE COMPONENTS OF MANAGEMENT
COMPENSATION.

 

THE
FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS IN THIS REPORT AND THE EXHIBIT HERETO ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT
ARE INHERENTLY SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTINGENCIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND LACQ’S AND THE COMPANY’S
CONTROL. WHILE ALL PROJECTIONS ARE NECESSARILY SPECULATIVE, LACQ AND THE COMPANY BELIEVE THAT THE PREPARATION OF PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL
INFORMATION INVOLVES INCREASINGLY HIGHER LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY THE FURTHER OUT THE PROJECTION EXTENDS FROM THE DATE OF PREPARATION.
THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE PROJECTED RESULTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT
BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED
IN THE PROJECTIONS. THE INCLUSION OF PROJECTIONS IN THIS REPORT AND THE EXHIBIT HERETO SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS AN INDICATION
THAT LACQ AND THE COMPANY, OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, CONSIDERED OR CONSIDER THE PROJECTIONS TO BE A RELIABLE PREDICTION OF FUTURE
EVENTS.

 

ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

THIS
REPORT AND THE EXHIBIT HERETO ARE NOT A PROXY STATEMENT OR SOLICITATION OF A PROXY, CONSENT OR AUTHORIZATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY
SECURITIES OR IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO
BUY ANY SECURITIES, NOR SHALL THERE BE ANY SALE OF ANY SECURITIES IN ANY STATE OR JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH OFFER, SOLICITATION,
OR SALE WOULD BE UNLAWFUL PRIOR TO REGISTRATION OR QUALIFICATION UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF SUCH STATE OR JURISDICTION.
