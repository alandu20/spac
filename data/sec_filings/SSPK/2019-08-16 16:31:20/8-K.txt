Item 8.01 Other Events.

 

On August 12, 2019,
Silver Spike Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 25,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the
Company (“Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share
for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000.

 

Substantially concurrently
with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 7,000,000 warrants
(the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Silver Spike Sponsor, LLC at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement
Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,000,000.

 

A total of $250,000,000,
comprised of $245,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO, including $8,750,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount, and
$5,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. An audited balance sheet
as of August 12, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
