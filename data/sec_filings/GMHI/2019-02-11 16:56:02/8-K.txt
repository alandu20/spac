 Other Events. 
On February 5, 2019, Gores Metropoulos, Inc. (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (the
IPO) of 40,000,000 units (the Units), including the issuance of 2,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of
Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class A Common Stock), and one-third of one warrant of the Company (Warrant),
each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $400,000,000.
 On February 5, 2019, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the Private
Placement) of 6,666,666 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Companys sponsor, Gores Metropoulos Sponsor LLC, generating gross proceeds to the
Company of approximately $10,000,000.  A total of $400,000,000, comprised of $392,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO, including
approximately $14,000,000 of the underwriters deferred discount, and $8,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, were placed in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
