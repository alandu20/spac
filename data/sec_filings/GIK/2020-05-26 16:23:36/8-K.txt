    Item 8.01
    Other Events.

 

As previously
disclosed by GigCapital3, Inc. (the “Company”) in its Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 18, 2020 (the “IPO Closing 8-K”), the Company
consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) on that date, resulting in the issuance of an aggregate of 20,000,000
units (the “Public Units”). Each Public Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock (a “Public
Share”), $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”), and three-fourths (3/4) of one redeemable warrant (a
 “Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50
per full share. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, and the IPO generated aggregate gross proceeds
of $200,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO and the sale of the Public Units,
the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of (i) 893,479 units (the “Private
Placement Units”), at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, with each of GigAcquisitions3, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the “Sponsor”) and the underwriters, pursuant to the respective Unit Purchase Agreements identified
above (collectively, the “Unit Purchase Agreements”). The Sponsor purchased 650,000 Private Placement Units;
and the Underwriters purchased 243,479 Private Placement Units in the aggregate. The Private Placement generated aggregate gross
proceeds of $8,934,790 consisting of $6,500,000 from the sale of the Private Placement Units to the Sponsor and $2,434,790 from
the sale of the Private Placement Units to the Underwriters. The Private Placement Units are substantially similar to the Public
Units, except for certain differences in the warrants included in the Private Placement Units (the “Private Warrants”)
as disclosed in the IPO Closing 8-K and in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-236626)
(the “Registration Statement”) as declared effective by the SEC on May 5, 2020, as amended by Post-Effective
Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement, as declared effective by the SEC on May 13, 2020.

 

A
total of $202,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account established for
the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the trust account
will be released until the earlier of: (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination within eighteen
(18) months from the closing of the IPO; (ii) the Company’s redemption of 100% of the outstanding Public Shares
if the Company has not completed an initial business combination within eighteen (18) months from the closing of the IPO;
or (iii) the Company’s redemption of the Public Shares in connection with the stockholder approval of any amendment
to the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation governing the Company’s pre-initial business
combination activity and related stockholders’ rights.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of May 18, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
