 Other Events. 
Surrender of Founder Shares  On
May 18, 2020, GigCapital3, Inc. (the Company) completed its initial public offering (IPO) of 20,000,000 units (Public Units), each Unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (a Public Share) and three-fourths (3/4) of one redeemable warrant (a Public Warrant), pursuant to the Companys registration statement on Form S-1,
as amended (File No. 333-236626). Each whole Public Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per full share. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per
Unit, generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000.  As previously reported on a Form S-1/A of the
Company, on April 22, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement for Founder Shares, dated April 16, 2020 (the Subscription Agreement), by and between the Company and GigAcquisitions3,
LLC (the Sponsor), pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to acquire 5,735,000 shares (Founder Shares) of the common stock, $.0001 par value per share, of the Company, including up to 750,000 Founder Shares
that Sponsor agreed to surrender and have cancelled in the event that Nomura Securities International, Inc. (Nomura), Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. (Oppenheimer), and Odeon Capital Group LLC (together with
Nomura and Oppenheimer, the Underwriters) did not fully exercise the underwriter over-allotment option.  The
Underwriters had 45 days from May 13, 2020 to exercise their over-allotment opinion, which period expired on June 27, 2020. As a result of the Underwriters not exercising their over-allotment option by June 27, 2020, the Sponsor will
be obligated, pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement, to surrender and cancel all of the 750,000 Founder Shares held by it that it agreed in the Subscription Agreement to surrender and have cancelled in the event that the Underwriters
did not exercise such over-allotment option. Such surrender and cancellation occurred on June 29, 2020.  Separation of Units 
On June 29, 2020, the Company issued a press release to announce that holders of the Companys public units may elect to separately
trade the common stock and warrants underlying such public units commencing on July 2, 2020. A copy of the press release is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and
incorporated herein by reference.
