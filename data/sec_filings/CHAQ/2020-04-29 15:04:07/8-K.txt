Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On April 23, 2020, the registration statement
(File No. 333-236977) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering (“IPO”) of
Chardan Healthcare Acquisition 2 Corp.(the “Company”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In connection therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:

 



     
    ●
    An Underwriting Agreement, dated April 23, 2020, by and between the Company and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”), as representative of the underwriters;





     
    ●
    A Warrant Agreement, dated April 23, 2020, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;





     
    ●
    Letter Agreements, dated April 23, 2020, by and between the Company’s officers, directors and shareholders;





     
    ●
    An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated April 23, 2020, by and between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the Company;





     
    ●
    An Escrow Agreement, dated April 23, 2020, by and among the Company, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and each of the initial shareholders of the Company; and

     
    ●
    Indemnity Agreements, dated April 23, 2020,
by and among the Company and the directors and officers of the Company;





     
    ●
    A Subscription Agreement, dated April 23, 2020,
by and between the Company and Chardan Investments 2, LLC;









     
    ●
    A Registration Rights Agreement, dated April 23, 2020, by and
    among the Company and the initial shareholders of the Company; and

     
    ●
    A Promissory Note, dated April 28, 2020, by and among the Company
and Chardan Investments 2, LLC

 

On April 28, 2020, the Company consummated the IPO of 8,500,000
units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”),
and one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50
per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $85,000,000. The Company
granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,275,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

As of April 28, 2020, a total of $85,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for
the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. An audited balance sheet as of April 28, 2020 reflecting receipt of the
proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement will be filed within 4 business days of the consummation of the
IPO.

 

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial
Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of Registrant.

 

On April 28, 2020, the Company issued an
unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000 (the “Note”) to Chardan Investments 2, LLC.
The Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a business combination by the Company.



 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the
IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Chardan Investments 2, LLC of 3,500,000
warrants (the “Private Warrants”) to purchase 3,500,000 shares of common stock, each at a price of $0.40 per Private
Warrant, generating total proceeds of $1,400,000.

 

The Private Warrants are identical to the
warrants sold in the IPO except that each Private Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of
$11.50 per share, and the Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long
as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed
not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described
in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers
were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Warrants.

 

The Private Warrants were issued pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.

 

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On April 23, 2020, in connection with the
IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State. The terms of
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are set forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by
reference.
