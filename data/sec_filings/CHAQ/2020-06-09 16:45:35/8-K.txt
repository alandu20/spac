Item 8.01. Other Events

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K dated April 23, 2020, Chardan Healthcare Acquisition 2 Corp. (the “Company”), consummated its initial public
offering (“IPO”) of 8,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001
par value (“Common Stock”), and one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one
share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of $85,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,275,000 additional Units
to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

As also previously disclosed in the Current
Report, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”)
with Chardan Investments 2, LLC of 3,500,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) to purchase 3,500,000 shares of common
stock, each at a price of $0.40 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $1,400,000.

 

Subsequently, on June 4, 2020, the underwriters
exercised the over-allotment option in part, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the “Over-Allotment
Option Units”) on June 5, 2020. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 122,644 units at a price of $10.00 per unit
resulted in total gross proceeds of $1,226,440.

 

On June 5, 2020, the underwriters canceled
the remainder of the over-allotment option. In connection with the cancellation of the remainder of the over-allotment option,
the Company has canceled an aggregate of 288,089 shares of Common Stock issued to certain stockholder of the Company prior to the
IPO and Private Placement.

 

A total of $86,226,440 of the net proceeds
from the sale of Units in the initial public offering (including the Over-Allotment Option Units) and the Private Placement on
April 28, 2020, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. Included
with this report as Exhibit 99.1 is a pro-forma balance sheet reflecting the exercise of the over-allotment option.
