 Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain
Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  On June 22, 2020, the Board of Directors (the Board) of
Fortress Value Acquisition Corp. (the Company) elected Carmen Policy to serve as a director of the Company. The Board also appointed Mr. Policy to serve as a member of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, having previously determined that Mr. Policy satisfied all applicable requirements to serve on such committees, including without limitation the applicable independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Upon Mr. Policys appointment to the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, R. Edward Albert III, a member of those respective
committees not meeting such independence requirements was removed. Following the appointment of Mr. Policy, the Companys Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee each consists of Aaron
Hood, Carmen Policy and Andrew McKnight. Mr. Policy will serve until the second Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until his successor shall be elected and duly qualified. 
Carmen Policy has served as a consultant and arbitrator for the National Football League (NFL) and certain NFL teams since 2014.
In addition, since 2003, Mr. Policy has been the President and Chief Executive Officer of Five Vines, LLC and oversees the operations and sales of the companys vineyard and winery under the label of Casa Piena. From 2011 to 2015,
Mr. Policy served as a lead consultant to Lennar Corporation and the city of San Francisco on the planning and development of the Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Point redevelopment projects. Prior to that, Mr. Policy was President,
Chief Executive Officer and minority owner of the Cleveland Browns from 1998 to 2004 and President and Chief Executive of the San Francisco 49ers from 1991-1998. The Company believes Mr. Policy is well qualified to serve on the Board due to his
extensive managerial experience.  There are no arrangements or understandings between the Mr. Policy and any other person pursuant to
which he was elected as a director of the Company, and there are no family relationships between Mr. Policy and any of the Companys other directors or executive officers. 
In connection with Mr. Policys appointment, he and the Company entered into (i) an indemnification agreement and (ii) a
joinder to each of the letter agreement and the registration rights agreement, each dated as of April 29, 2020, entered into by the Company with its directors (and the other parties thereto) in connection with the Companys initial public
offering. Each of the director indemnification agreement, the letter agreement and the registration rights agreement was described in, and the forms of which were filed as exhibits to, the Companys registration statement relating to the
Companys initial public offering (File No. 333-205734) and the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2020 (File No. 001-39277) with respect to the letter agreement.  In connection with his appointment as a
director of the Company, Mr. Policy will receive 25,000 founder shares from the Companys sponsor, Fortress Acquisition Sponsor LLC.
