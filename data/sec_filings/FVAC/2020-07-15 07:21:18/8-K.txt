Item 1.01
 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
On July 15, 2020, Fortress Value Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (Parent), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
Merger Agreement), by and among Parent, FVAC Merger Corp. I, a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (MPMO Merger Corp.), FVAC Merger LLC
II, a Delaware limited liability company that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (SNR Merger Company), FVAC
Merger LLC III, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (MPMO Merger LLC), FVAC Merger LLC IV, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (SNR Merger LLC and, together with MPMO Merger Corp., SNR Merger Company and MPMO Merger LLC, the Merger Subs), MP Mine Operations LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (MPMO) and Secure Natural Resources LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (SNR and, together with MPMO, each a Company and collectively, the
Companies). The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will constitute a Business Combination as contemplated by Parents Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
Charter).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, (a) the Companies will, prior to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, complete a reorganization (the Pre-Closing Reorganization), pursuant to which, among other things, MPMO or an affiliate of an equityholder
thereof will form a new Delaware corporation (MPMO Holdco), and SNR will form a new Delaware limited liability company that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (SNR HoldCo), (b)
through two consecutive mergers constituting part of the same overall transaction, MPMO Merger Corp. will merge with and into MPMO Holdco, with MPMO HoldCo being the surviving corporation, and immediately thereafter MPMO Holdco will merge with and

with and into SNR Holdco, with SNR Holdco being the surviving company, and immediately thereafter SNR Holdco will merge with and into SNR Merger LLC, with SNR Merger LLC being the surviving company (such mergers, the SNR Mergers,
and together with the MPMO Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination). As a result of the Business Combination, each of MPMO and SNR will be an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent.  The Merger Agreement and the Business Combination were unanimously approved by the board of directors of Parent (the
Parent Board) on July 14, 2020.  The Merger Agreement 
Consideration  Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, the consideration to be paid in respect of each share of common stock of MPMO HoldCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the first of the MPMO Mergers (the number of such issued and outstanding shares,

Parent, the Merger Subs and the Companies have made representations, warranties and covenants that are customary for a transaction of this nature. The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement terminate and are of no further

The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including
(a) by mutual written consent of the parties, (b) by either Parent or the Companies if (i) the consummation of the Business Combination has not occurred on or prior to March 31, 2021 (the Outside Date), (ii) a
final and nonappealable order has been issued or governmental action permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Business Combination or (iii) Parents stockholder approval is not obtained, (c) by the Companies upon a

declared effective by the SEC.  A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K (this
Current Report) as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. The Merger Agreement contains representations,
warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of the Merger Agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract
among the 
   3 









 
respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. Investors and security holders are not
third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties or covenants, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Merger
Agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement are also modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules which are not filed publicly and which are subject to a contractual standard of materiality
different from that generally applicable to stockholders and were used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. We do not believe that these schedules contain information that is material to an
investment decision. Before making any voting or investment decisions, stockholders are encouraged to read the S-4 Registration Statement / Proxy Statement and any other relevant documents carefully and in
their entirety when they become available because they will contain important information about the proposed business combination.  The Subscription
Agreements, Support Agreements, Exchange Agreement, Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement and Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement 
Subscription Agreements  Concurrently with the execution
of the Merger Agreement, Parent entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements) with certain investors (the PIPE Investors), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to purchase an
aggregate amount of at least $200,000,000 in shares of Parent Class A Stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, substantially concurrent with, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Business Combination (the PIPE).
 A copy of the form of Subscription Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and is
incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Subscription Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. 
Support Agreements  The equityholders of MPMO holding at
least a majority of the common units of MPMO issued and outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement have executed and delivered to Parent a support agreement (the MPMO Support Agreement) and (b) the equityholders of
SNR holding at least a majority of the common units of SNR issued and outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement have executed and delivered to Parent a support agreement (the SNR Support Agreement, and together with the
MPMO Support Agreement, the Support Agreements), pursuant to which, among other things, such equityholders have agreed to support the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, subject to
certain customary conditions.  Copies of the Support Agreements are filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as
Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 and are incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Support Agreements are qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. 
Parent Sponsor Warrant Exchange Agreement  Concurrently
with the execution the Merger Agreement, Parent and Fortress Acquisition Sponsor LLC (Sponsor) entered into an exchange agreement (the Parent Sponsor Warrant Exchange Agreement), pursuant to which Sponsor agreed
to exchange all 5,933,333 of its warrants to purchase one share of Parent Class A Stock (the Private Placement Warrants) for an aggregate of 890,000 shares of Class F common stock of Parent (Parent
Class F Stock), subject to and immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.  A copy of the Parent
Sponsor Warrant Exchange Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.4 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Parent Sponsor Warrant Exchange
Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. 
   4 









 Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the holders of Parent Class F Stock (the Class F Holders)
have entered into an amended and restated letter agreement (the Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement), pursuant to which the Class F Holders agreed to (a) vote all of their Parent Class F Stock in favor of the Business
Combination and certain other matters, (b) certain restrictions on their Parent Class F Stock (other than any Parent Class F Stock received in exchange for Private Placement Warrants), in each case upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, and (c) subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, if the (1)(A) amount of cash available in Parents trust account (the
Trust Account), less (ii) any amounts required to satisfy the Parent stockholder redemptions, plus (2) the amount of the PIPE (the PIPE Investment Amount), is less than $495 million,
then each Class F Holder shall surrender to Parent a number of Parent Class F Stock equal to such Class F Holders pro rata share of the product of (x) 8,625,000 and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is (I)
$495 million, minus (II)(A) the cash available in the Trust Account after deducting the amount required to satisfy redemptions, plus (B) the PIPE Investment Amount, and the denominator of which is $495 million (the
Surrendered Shares). The Class F Holders agree that, as of the consummation of the Business Combination, all of the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Founder
Shares following Sponsors surrender of the Surrendered Shares (the Vesting Shares) shall be unvested and shall be subject to certain vesting and forfeiture provisions, as follows: (aa) 50% of the Vesting Shares beneficially
owned by Sponsor and each of the other parties thereto shall vest at such time as a $12.00 Stock Price Level is achieved on or before the date that is ten years after the Closing, (bb) 25% of the Vesting Shares beneficially owned by Sponsor and each
of the parties thereto shall vest at such time as a $14.00 Stock Price Level is achieved on or before the date that is ten years after the Closing and (cc) 25% of the Vesting Shares beneficially owned by Class F Holders shall vest at such time
as a $16.00 Stock Price Level is achieved on or before the date that is ten years after the Closing. As used in this Current Report on Form 8-K, the applicable Stock Price Level will be considered
achieved only when the VWAP of Parent Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange equals or exceeds the applicable threshold for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period. 
A copy of the Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.5 and is
incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Letter Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.

Forward-Looking Statements  Certain statements
included in this Current Report on Form 8-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
may be identified by the use of the words such as  estimate, plan, project, forecast, intend, expect, anticipate, believe, seek,
target, or similar expressions that predict or indicate future events 
   5 









 
or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of other financial and
performance metrics and projections of market opportunity. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this Current Report on Form 8-K, and on the current expectations of the Companies and Parents
management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a
prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of the Companies
and Parents. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; the inability of the parties to
successfully or timely consummate the transaction; the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of
the transaction; the risk that the approval of the shareholders of the Companies or stockholders of Parents is not obtained; the risk that any of the conditions to closing are not satisfied in the anticipated manner or on the anticipated
timeline; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction; risks relating to the uncertainty of the projected financial information with respect to the Companies; risks related to the rollout of the Companies business
strategy and the timing of expected business milestones; risks related to the Companies arrangements with Shenghe; the effects of competition on the Companies future business; risks related to political and macroeconomic uncertainty; the
amount of redemption requests made by Parents public stockholders; the ability of Parents or the combined company to issue equity or equity-linked securities in connection with the transaction or in the future; the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on any of the foregoing risks; and those factors discussed in Parents final prospectus filed on May 1, 2020 under the heading Risk Factors, and other documents of
Parents filed, or to be filed, with the SEC. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional
risks that neither Parents nor the Companies presently know or that Parents and the Companies currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking
statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Parents and the Companies expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. Parents and the Companies
anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause Parents and the Companies assessments to change. However, while Parents and the Companies may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the
future, Parents and the Companies specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, unless required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Parents and the Companies
assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. 
Disclaimer  This Current Report shall neither
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification
under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. This Current Report relates to a proposed business combination between Parents and the Companies. 
Additional Information About the Proposed Business Combination and Where To Find It

persons are advised to read, once available, the preliminary proxy statement and any amendments thereto and, once available, the definitive proxy statement / prospectus, in connection with Parents solicitation of proxies for its special
