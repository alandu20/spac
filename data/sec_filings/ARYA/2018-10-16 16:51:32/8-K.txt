Item 1.01.
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
October 10, 2018, ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 14,375,000 of its units (“Units”), each Unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value per
share (“Ordinary Shares”), and one half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrants”), each whole Warrant entitling
the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $143,750,000.

 

In
connection with the consummation of the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to
the Registration Statement:

 



     
    ●

    which establishes the trust account that will hold the IPO proceeds, and sets forth the responsibilities of the trustee; the
    procedures for withdrawal and direction of funds from the trust account; and indemnification of the trustee by the Company
    under the agreement.

    the Sponsor, and customary piggy-back registration rights for such independent directors, as well as certain transfer restrictions
    applicable to the Sponsor with respect to the Company’s securities, and, upon consummation of our initial business combination
    and for so long as our Sponsor and its permitted transferees collectively hold at least 50% of the number of Ordinary Shares
    held by the Sponsor upon consummation of this offering, calculated on a fully-converted basis, the right of the Sponsor to
    nominate one person for election to the Company’s board of directors.

    pursuant to which each officer and director of the Company has agreed to vote any Ordinary Shares held by him or her in favor
    of the Company’s initial business combination; to facilitate the liquidation and winding up of the Company if an initial
    business combination is not consummated within 24 months; to certain transfer restrictions with respect to the Company’s
    securities; not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until
    the Company has entered into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination or has failed to consummate
    an initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of the IPO.


     
     
     

     
    ●
    Letter Agreement,
    dated October 10, 2018, by and between the Company and the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to vote any Ordinary
    Shares held by it in favor of the Company’s initial business combination; to facilitate the liquidation and winding
    up of the Company if an initial business combination is not consummated within 24 months; and to certain transfer restrictions
    with respect to the Company’s securities.

    Administrative Services
    Agreement, dated October 10, 2018, by and between the Company and the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to

Item 8.01.
Other Events.

 

Simultaneous
with the consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale of the Units, the Company consummated a private placement with the
Sponsor of 5,953,125 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating total proceeds of $5,953,125 (the “Private Placement”).
A total of $143,750,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account established
for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the trust account
will be released until the earlier of the completion of the Company’s initial business combination or the redemption of
100% of the Class A Ordinary Shares issued by the Company in the IPO if the Company is unable to consummate an initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of October 10, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the
consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
