Item 7.01
 Regulation FD Disclosure. 
On April 15, 2020, Immatics B.V. (TopCo) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) a
registration statement on Form F-4 which contains a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus for the anticipated annual general meeting of shareholders of ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp.
(ARYA), at which ARYAs proposed business combination (the Business Combination) with Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH (Immatics) will be considered and voted upon. While the registration statement has not yet
become effective and the information contained therein is subject to change, it provides important information about ARYA, Immatics, TopCo and the Business Combination. 
The registration statement containing the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus is available through the SECs website
at www.sec.gov under TopCos filings.  Additional Information 
In connection with the Business Combination, TopCo has filed a Registration Statement on
Form F-4, which includes a preliminary prospectus of TopCo and preliminary proxy statement of ARYA. ARYA will mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to its
shareholders. The information in the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus is not complete and may be changed. Investors and security holders of ARYA are advised to read, when available, the definitive proxy statement/prospectus
in connection with ARYAs solicitation of proxies for its annual general meeting of shareholders, at which the Business Combination (and related matters) will be considered and voted upon, because the definitive proxy statement/prospectus will
contain important information about the Business Combination and the parties to the Business Combination. The definitive proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to shareholders of ARYA that hold their shares in
street name as of a record date to be established for voting on the Business Combination; shareholders that hold their shares in registered form are entitled to vote their shares held on the date of the meeting. Shareholders will also be
able to obtain copies of the definitive proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, once available, on the SEC website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp., 51 Astor Place, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10003. 
Participants in the Solicitation 
ARYA, Immatics, TopCo and their respective directors, executive officers, other members of management, and employees, under SEC rules, may be
deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of ARYAs shareholders in connection with the Business Combination. Investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names and
interests in the Business Combination of ARYAs and Immatics directors and officers in the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus described above. 
Disclaimer  This communication is
for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, subscribe for or buy any securities or the solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction pursuant to the Business Combination or otherwise,
nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer or securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the
Securities Act.
