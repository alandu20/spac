 Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 
On March 17, 2020, ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp. (ARYA) held a previously announced joint conference call (the
Conference Call) with Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH (Immatics) to discuss the proposed business combination (the Business Combination) between ARYA and Immatics. 
Attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 7.01 by
reference is a transcript of the Conference Call. A copy of the Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Business Combination Agreement), by and among ARYA, Immatics
B.V. (TopCo), Immatics, Immatics Merger Sub 1 and Immatics Merger Sub 2, related to the Business Combination was attached as Exhibit 2.1 to ARYAs Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 17, 2020.  The foregoing (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished
pursuant to Item 7.01 and will not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section, nor will it
be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or the Exchange Act. 
Item 8.01 Other Events  The
information included under Item 7.01 above is incorporated herein by reference.  Additional Information 
In connection with the proposed transactions, TopCo intends to file a Registration Statement on
Form F-4, which will include a preliminary prospectus of TopCo and preliminary proxy statement of ARYA. ARYA will mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to its
shareholders. Investors and security holders of ARYA are advised to read, when available, the proxy statement/prospectus in connection with ARYAs solicitation of proxies for its extraordinary general meeting of shareholders
to be held to approve the proposed transaction (and related matters) because the proxy statement/prospectus will contain important information about the proposed transaction and the parties to the proposed transaction. The definitive
proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to shareholders of ARYA as of a record date to be established for voting on the proposed transaction. Shareholders will also be able to obtain copies of the proxy statement/prospectus, without
charge, once available, on the SEC website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp., 51 Astor Place, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10003. 
Participants in the Solicitation 
ARYA, Immatics, TopCo and their respective directors, executive officers, other members of management, and employees, under SEC rules, may be
deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of ARYAs shareholders in connection with the Business Combination. Investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names and
interests in the Business Combination of ARYAs directors and officers in ARYAs filings with the SEC, including ARYAs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on March 6, 2020, and such information and names of Immatics directors and executive officers will also be in the Registration Statement on
Form F-4 to be filed with the SEC by TopCo, which will include the proxy statement of ARYA for the Business Combination. 
Forward Looking Statements 
Certain statements made herein are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as believe, may, will, estimate,
continue, anticipate, intend, expect, should, would, plan, predict,
potential, seem, seek, future, outlook and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical
matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future events, the Business Combination, the estimated or anticipated future results and benefits of the combined company following the









 
Business Combination, including the likelihood and ability of the parties to successfully consummate the Business Combination, future opportunities for the combined company, and other statements
that are not historical facts. These statements are based on the current expectations of ARYAs management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not
intended to serve as, and must not be relied on, by any investor as a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from
assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Arya and Immatics. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties regarding ARYAs businesses and the Business Combination, and actual results may
differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic, political and business conditions; applicable taxes, inflation, interest rates and the regulatory environment; the outcome of judicial proceedings to
which Immatics is or may become a party; the inability of the parties to consummate the Business Combination or the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Business Combination Agreement;
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties following the announcement of the Business Combination; the receipt of an unsolicited offer from another party for an alternative business transaction that could
interfere with the Business Combination; the risk that the approval of the shareholders of ARYA or Immatics for the potential transaction is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, including as a result
of a delay in consummating the potential transaction or difficulty in integrating the businesses of ARYA and Immatics; the risk that the Business Combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of
the Business Combination; the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; the amount of redemption requests made by ARYAs shareholders; the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of
the post-acquisition companys securities on Nasdaq following the Business Combination; costs related to the Business Combination; and those factors discussed in ARYAs Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on March 6, 2020 under the heading Risk Factors, as updated from time to time by ARYAs
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents of ARYA on file with the SEC or in the proxy statement that will be filed, or to be filed, with the SEC by ARYA. There may be additional risks that
ARYA presently does not know or that ARYA currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements provide ARYAs
expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. ARYA anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause ARYAs assessments to change. However, while ARYA may elect to update these
forward-looking statements at some point in the future, ARYA specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing ARYAs assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of
this communication. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.  Disclaimer 
This communication is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, subscribe
for or buy any securities or the solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction pursuant to the Business Combination or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer or securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law.
No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act.  Item 9.01
