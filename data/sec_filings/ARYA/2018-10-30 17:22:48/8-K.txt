Item 8.01. Other Events.

On
October 30, 2018, ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) announced that the holders of the Company’s
units (the “Units”) may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A
Ordinary Shares”), and warrants included in the Units commencing on November 2, 2018. Each Unit consists of one Class A
Ordinary Share and one-half of one warrant to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share. Any Units not separated will
continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “ARYAU.” Any underlying Class A
Ordinary Shares and warrants that are separated are expected to trade on Nasdaq under the symbols “ARYA” and “ARYAW,”
respectively. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of
Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer
agent, in order to separate the holders’ Units into Class A Ordinary Shares and warrants.

A
copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is attached
hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
