Item 3.01
 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
 On January 2, 2020, ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp. (the Company) received a letter (the
Notification Letter) from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ) notifying the Company that it no longer complies with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing due to
its failure to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months of the end of the Companys fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Company has 45 calendar days from January 2, 2020 to submit a plan to regain compliance.
If NASDAQ accepts the Companys plan, NASDAQ may grant an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the fiscal year end, or until June 29, 2020, to regain compliance. 
The Notification Letter does not impact the Companys listing on NASDAQ at this time, and the Companys Class A ordinary
shares, units and warrants will continue to trade on NASDAQ under the symbols ARYA, ARYAU and ARYAW, respectively. 
The Company does not expect that the Notification Letter will affect its ability to consummate an initial business combination. The Company
intends to file and mail to its shareholders a definitive proxy statement and to hold an annual meeting prior to June 29, 2020 to regain compliance with the NASDAQ listing rules. 
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
The information included herein includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of present or historical fact included herein, regarding the Companys ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5620(a), prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward looking statements. When used herein the words could, should, will, may, believe, anticipate,
intend, estimate, expect, project, the negative of such terms and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such
identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on managements current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. Except as
otherwise required by applicable law, the Company disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. The
Company cautions you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Should one or more of these risks occur, or
should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results and plans could different materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these and other factors that may impact the Companys
expectations and projections can be found in its periodic filings with the SEC, including the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Companys SEC
filings are available publicly on the SECs website at www.sec.gov.
