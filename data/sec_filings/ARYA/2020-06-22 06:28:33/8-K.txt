 Item 8.01 Other Events 
Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement 
As previously disclosed, on March 17, 2020, ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (ARYA or
the Company), entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Business Combination Agreement), by and among ARYA, Immatics B.V., a
Netherlands private limited liability company (TopCo), Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH, a German limited liability company (Immatics), Immatics Merger Sub 1, a Cayman Islands exempted company, and Immatics Merger
Sub 2, a Cayman Islands exempted company.  On June 17, 2020, the Company received a letter (the Shareholder
Letter) from a purported shareholder of ARYA claiming certain allegedly material omissions in the definitive proxy statement filed on June 10, 2020 by ARYA (the Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (together, the Business Combination).   While ARYA believes
that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot the plaintiffs disclosure claims in the Shareholder Letter, to avoid nuisance, cost and distraction, and to preclude any efforts to delay
the closing of the Business Combination, ARYA has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the Supplemental Disclosures). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures
shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, ARYA specifically denies all allegations in the Shareholder Letter that any additional disclosure
was or is required. ARYA believes the Shareholder Letter is without merit.  Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement 
The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page
references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement. 
The following disclosure replaces the paragraph under the heading Comparable Company Analysis on page 142 of the Proxy
Statement.  Adam Stone, Chief Executive Officer of ARYA, Michael Altman, Chief Financial Officer of ARYA, and certain employees
of Perceptive Advisors reviewed certain financial information of Immatics and compared it to certain publicly traded companies, selected based on the experience and the professional judgment of ARYAs management team. 
The following disclosure replaces the first paragraph on page 136 of the Proxy Statement under the heading Background of the
Business Combination.  ARYAs management looked to identify targets that (a) have a scientific or other
competitive advantage in the markets in which they operate and which can benefit from access to additional capital as well as ARYAs managements industry relationships and expertise; (b) are ready to be public, with strong
management, corporate governance and reporting policies in place; (c) would be likely to be well received by public investors and are expected to have good access to the public capital markets in the future; (d) have significant embedded
and/or underexploited growth opportunities; (e) exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that ARYAs management believes have been unevaluated by the market based on its analysis and scientific and business due diligence review;
and (f) will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for ARYAs shareholders. In the process that led to identifying Immatics as an attractive business combination opportunity, ARYAs management team 








 evaluated, conducted preliminary due diligence based on publicly available information and other market
research and engaged in various levels of discussions with a number of different potential business combination targets across subsectors of the life sciences and medical technology sectors. In connection with such evaluation, preliminary due
diligence and discussions, ARYA entered into non-disclosure agreements with more than ten potential business combination targets and submitted non-binding indications of
interest or letters of intent with respect to three potential business combination targets (other than Immatics) with equity values ranging from $300 to $550 million (based on preliminary diligence and valuation analysis conducted by ARYA and
its advisors). Such non-disclosure agreements contained customary terms for a special purpose acquisition company and a private company target, including confidentiality provisions and use restrictions for
information provided by the target and exceptions to such provisions. Two of these potential business combination targets were pre-market biopharmaceutical companies with pipeline product candidates that
required additional funding to further R&D efforts, and one of these potential business combination targets was a medical technology company with an existing product in the market. Each of these proposals contemplated that shares in the
post-business combination company would represent substantially all of the consideration to be received by the equityholders of the potential target. After submitting these non-binding indications of interest
or letters of intent, ARYA engaged in varying levels of additional discussions, negotiations and due diligence with these potential targets based on, among other factors, interest by, and due diligence access granted by, the potential target and
terms on which these potential targets would be willing to consider a potential transaction (such as the equity valuation ascribed to the potential target). In each case, following these additional discussions, negotiations and due diligence, ARYA
ultimately determined to abandon each of its other potential acquisition opportunities either because (i) the potential target pursued an alternative transaction or strategy, (ii) ARYA did not meet the valuation expectations of the
potential target, or (iii) ARYA concluded that the target business would not be a suitable business combination opportunity for ARYA based on, among other factors, further due diligence indicating that the target business did not meet the
criteria ARYA had established and the terms on which the potential target would be willing to consider a potential transaction.  The
following disclosure replaces the first paragraph on page 138 of the Proxy Statement under the heading Background of the Business Combination. 
Between January 29, 2020 and March 17, 2020, K&E and Goodwin exchanged revised drafts of the Business Combination Agreement and
the related ancillary agreements, and engaged in negotiations of such documents and agreements. The various revised drafts reflected divergent views on, among other things, certain risk allocation points, closing conditionality and matters related
to post-closing ownership. Over the same period of time, the representatives and advisors for ARYA and Immatics held numerous conference calls and came to agreement on various outstanding business issues, including, among others:
(i) calculation of the transaction consideration, and the form such consideration would take, to be received by the Immatics equityholders (including the adjustments thereto and how the existing holders of Immatics SARs would participate in the
post-closing ownership of TopCo), and the respective post-closing ownership amounts of the Immatics equityholders, the ARYA shareholders and the PIPE Investors (based on the agreed upon equity valuation of Immatics of $350,000,000, a per share value
for the TopCo Shares of $10.00, the amount of cash anticipated to be available at closing in the Trust Account and the anticipated proceeds of the PIPE Financing); (ii) the percentage of Participating Shareholders needed to satisfy the closing
condition in favor of ARYA; (iii) whether (A) the Aggregate TopCo Transaction Proceeds Condition would be a condition in favor of only certain parties or all parties and (B) an additional funding condition with respect to the Aggregate
PIPE Proceeds would be included in favor of any party; (iv) the bring-down standard for purposes of the representation and warranty bring-down by the parties at the Closing; and (v) the overall suite of representations, warranties and
covenants to be provided by each party under the BCA. For further information related to the final resolution of items (i) through (v), please see the sections entitled Consideration to Immatics Equityholders in the Business
Combination, Conditions to Closing of the Business Combination, Representations and Warranties and Covenants and for a description of the analysis conducted by
ARYAs management team with respect to the equity valuation of Immatics, see Summary of ARYA Financial Analysis. In the context of negotiating the Investor Rights Agreement, the parties agreed that the ARYA Initial
Shareholders would be entitled for a period of time to nominate two individuals to serve on the Board of Directors of TopCo following the consummation of the Business Combination. One of the nominees selected by the ARYA Initial Shareholders was
Adam Stone, Chief Executive Officer and a director of ARYA. The remainder of the ARYA Board and ARYAs officers will no longer serve as directors or officers, and will not otherwise be employees of, ARYA, TopCo or any of their respective
subsidiaries upon consummation of the Business Combination.

statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the

not limited to, general economic, political and business conditions; applicable taxes, inflation, interest rates and the regulatory environment; the outcome of judicial proceedings to which Immatics is or may become a party; the inability of the
parties to consummate the Business Combination or the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Business Combination Agreement; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted
