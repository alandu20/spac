 Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders. 
On June 29, 2020, ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp. (ARYA) held an annual general meeting of its shareholders (the
General Meeting), at which holders of 12,268,746 ordinary shares (consisting of 8,674,996 Class A ordinary shares and 3,593,750 Class B ordinary shares) were present in person or by proxy, representing 68.28% of the
voting power of ARYAs ordinary shares as of the date of the General Meeting, and constituting a quorum for the transaction of business. The proposal listed below is described in more detail in the registration statement on Form F-4 (the Registration Statement) of Immatics B.V. (TopCo), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on June 10,
2020 and includes a combined prospectus of TopCo with respect to the securities to be issued in connection with proposed business combination of ARYA with Immatics Biotechnologies GmbHs (Immatics) (the Business
Combination) and a definitive proxy statement of ARYA with respect to the General Meeting (the Proxy Statement). A summary of the voting results at the General Meeting is set forth below: 
The shareholders approved the Business Combination Agreement, dated March 17, 2020 (as amended), by and among ARYA, Immatics, TopCo,
Immatics Merger Sub 1 and Immatics Merger Sub 2, the Business Combination, the First Merger, the Second Merger and the Plans of Merger (each as defined in the Proxy Statement). The voting results for this proposal were as follows:
