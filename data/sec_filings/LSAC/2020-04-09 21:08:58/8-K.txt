EXPLANATORY NOTE

 



This Form 8-K/A is filed as an amendment (Amendment No. 1) to
the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by LifeSci Acquisition Corp.. on March 26, 2020. Amendment No. 1 is being filed to correct
an error in Item 8.01 regarding the description of the Private Placement (as defined below).



 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

The information included in Item 8.01 is incorporated into this
Item by reference.

 

Item 8.01. Other Events

 

As previously disclosed on a Current Report
on Form 8-K dated March 10, 2020, LifeSci Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), consummated its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of 6,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par
value (“Common Stock”) and one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one share
of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds of $60,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover
over-allotments, if any.

 

As also previously disclosed in the Current
Report, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”)
of 2,570,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $0.50 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of
$1,285,000.

 

Subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the underwriters
exercised the over-allotment option in part, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the “Over-Allotment
Option Units”) on March 20, 2020. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 563,767 units at a price of $10.00 per unit
resulted in total gross proceeds of $5,637,670. On March 20, 2020, the underwriters canceled the remainder of the over-allotment
option. In connection with the cancellation of the remainder of the over-allotment option, the Company has canceled an aggregate
of 84,058 shares of Common Stock issued to LifeSci Investments, LLC, the Company’s sponsor, prior to the IPO and Private
Placement.

 



A total of $65,637,670 of the net proceeds
from the sale of Units in the initial public offering (including the Over-Allotment Option Units) and the Private Placement on
March 10, 2020 and March 20, 2020, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders.
Included with this report as Exhibit 99.1 is a pro-forma balance sheet reflecting the exercise of the over-allotment option.
