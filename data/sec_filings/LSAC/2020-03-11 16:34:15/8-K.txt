Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On March 5, 2020, the registration
statement (File Nos. 333-236466 and 333-236929) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the initial public offering
(“IPO”) of LifeSci Acquisition Corp.(the “Company”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In connection therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements previously filed as exhibits to the Registration
Statement:

 



     
    ●
    An Underwriting Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and between the Company and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”), as representative of the underwriters;

 



     
    ●
    A Warrant Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;

 



     
    ●
    Letter Agreements, dated March 5, 2020, by and between the Company’s officers, directors and shareholders;

 



     
    ●
    An Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the Company;

     
     
     

     
    ●
    
        An Administrative Services Agreement, dated March 5,
2020, by and between the Company and LifeSci Capital LLC;

     
     
     

     
    ●
    A Subscription Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and between the Company and LifeSci Holdings LLC;

     
     
     

     
    ●
    A Subscription Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and between the Company and Rosedale Park, LLC;

 



     
    ●
    A Stock Escrow Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and among the Company, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and each of the initial shareholders of the Company; and

 



     
    ●
    A Registration and Stockholder Rights Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and among the Company, LifeSci Holdings LLC, Rosedale Park, LLC and the initial shareholders of the Company.

 

On March 10, 2020, the Company consummated the IPO of 6,000,000
units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”),
and one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50
per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. The Company
granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

As of March 10, 2020, a total of $60,000,000
of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for
the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. An audited balance sheet as of March 10, 2020 reflecting receipt of
the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement will be filed within 4 business days of the consummation of
the IPO.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the
IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with (i) LifeSci Holdings LLC of 1,570,000
warrants (the “Private Warrants”) and (ii) Rosedale Park, LLC of 1,000,000 Private Warrants, each at a price of
$0.50 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $1,285,000.

 

The Private Warrants are identical to the
warrants sold in the IPO except that each Private Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of
$11.50 per share, and the Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long
as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed
not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described
in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers
were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Warrants.

The Private Warrants were issued pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.

 

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On March 5, 2020, in connection with
the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The terms
of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are set forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein
by reference.
