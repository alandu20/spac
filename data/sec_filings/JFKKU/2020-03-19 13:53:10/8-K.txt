This
Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements
that are not historical facts, including statements about the pending Business Combination by and among JFK, Singapore NewCo,
BVI NewCo and Diginex and the transactions contemplated thereby, and the parties’ perspectives and expectations, are forward-looking
statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the proposed transaction, including the anticipated
initial enterprise value and post-closing equity value, the benefits of the proposed transaction, expected revenue opportunities,
anticipated future financial and operating performance and results, including estimates for growth, expected management and governance,
the ability to close the Business Combination, and the expected timing of the transactions contemplated by the (i) merger agreement
by and among Singapore NewCo, BVI NewCo and JFK, dated October 8, 2019, and (ii) share exchange agreement by and among JFK, Diginex,
the stockholders of Diginex set forth therein (the “Sellers”), and Pelham Limited, as the representative of the Sellers
(the “Representative”), dated July 9, 2019 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), as amended by the amendment
and joinder to the Share Exchange Agreement, dated October 8, 2019, by and among JFK, Singapore NewCo, BVI NewCo, the Sellers,
Diginex and the Representative (the “Amendment,” and together with the Share Exchange Agreement, the “Amended
Share Exchange Agreement”), and as further amended by the second amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement, dated January
28, 2020 by and among JFK, Singapore NewCo, BVI NewCo, the Sellers, Diginex and the Representative (the “Second Amendment,”
and together with the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, the “Second Amended Share Exchange Agreement”). The words
“expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” and similar expressions
indicate forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject
to various risks and uncertainties, assumptions (including assumptions about general economic, market, industry and operational
factors), known or unknown, which could cause the actual results to vary materially from those indicated or anticipated.

 



     
     
    

 

Such
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (i) risks related to the expected timing and likelihood of completion
of the Business Combination, including the risk that the Business Combination may not close due to one or more closing conditions
to the Business Combination not being satisfied or waived on a timely basis or otherwise; (ii) the occurrence of any event, change
or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Second Amended Share Exchange Agreement; (iii) the risk
that there may be a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition
(financial or otherwise), of Diginex or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iv) risks related to disruption of management time
from ongoing business operations due to the proposed Business Combination; (v) the risk that any announcements relating to the
proposed Business Combination could have adverse effects on the market price of JFK’s ordinary shares; and (vi) other risks
and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the Form F-4, including “Risk Factors” therein, and other factors
identified in JFK’s and Singapore NewCo’s prior and future filings with the SEC, available at www.sec.gov.

 

Should
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate only to the date they were made, and
JFK, Singapore NewCo, Diginex, and their respective subsidiaries undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements
to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made except as required by law or applicable regulation.
