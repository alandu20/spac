option in full. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-fourth
of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit,
generating gross proceeds to the Company of $230,000,000.

 

In connection with
the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, forms of which were previously filed as exhibits to the Company’s
Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-236578​) for the IPO, initially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
