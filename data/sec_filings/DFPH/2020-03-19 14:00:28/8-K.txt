Item 8.01.Other Events.

 

On March 13, 2020,
DFP Healthcare Acquisitions Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 23,000,000
units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 3,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their
over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share
(the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a “Warrant”),
each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share, subject to
adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $230,000,000.

 

On March 13, 2020,
simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of
an aggregate of 3,733,334 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to DFP Sponsor LLC at a purchase price of $1.50
per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,600,000.

 

A total of $230,000,000,
comprised of $226,400,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $6,300,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount)
and $3,600,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance
sheet as of March 13, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
