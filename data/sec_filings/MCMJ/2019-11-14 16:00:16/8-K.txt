Item 8.01.  Other Events.




 

On November 7, 2019,
the Company consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”) of 12,000,000 of its units (“Units”).
Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $.0001 par value (“Common Stock”), of the Company and one-half
of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each whole warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of
Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds
of $120,000,000.

	Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 3,750,000
warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total
proceeds of $3,750,000. The Private Placement Warrants were purchased by EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and the Company’s sponsor,
Merida Holdings, LLC. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO, except
that the Private Placement Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue
to be held by the initial stockholders or their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the Private Placement Warrants have agreed
not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants or Ordinary Shares underlying the Private Placement Warrants
(except to certain transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.

	An audited balance
sheet as of November 7, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the consummation of
the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form
8-K. A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement is included
as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

On November 13,
2019, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,001,552 Units that were subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment
option at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $10,015,520. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional
units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 200,311 Private Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating
total proceeds of $200,311. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Warrants, an aggregate
amount of $130,015,520 has been placed in the Company’s trust account established in connection with the IPO.
