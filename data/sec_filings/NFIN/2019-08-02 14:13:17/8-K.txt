(“IPO”) of 25,300,000 units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 3,300,000 Units as a result of

Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one redeemable warrant of the Company
(“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per
