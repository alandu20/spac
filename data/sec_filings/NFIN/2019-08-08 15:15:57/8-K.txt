    Other Events.

 

On August 2, 2019, Netfin
Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 25,300,000 units (the
“Units”), including the issuance of 3,300,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment
option in full. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class
A Ordinary Shares”), and one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $253,000,000.

 

Simultaneously with the
closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of 681,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) to MVR
Netfin LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the
Company of $6,810,000. 

 

A total of $253,000,000,
comprised of $247,940,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $8,855,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount)
and $5,060,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An audited balance sheet
as of August 2, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued
