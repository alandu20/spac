Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder
to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share and one right (“Right”) to receive
one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price
of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000.

 

As of February 19, 2020, a total of $57,500,000
of the proceeds from the IPO and the private placement consummated simultaneously with the closing of the IPO were deposited
