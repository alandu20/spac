Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
February 13, 2020, the registration statement (File No. 333-235788) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the
initial public offering (“IPO”) of Newborn Acquisition Corp.(the “Company”) was declared effective by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection therewith, the Company entered into the following agreements previously
filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement:

 


●An
Underwriting Agreement, dated February 13, 2020, by and between the Company and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”),
as representative of the underwriters;

 


●A
Warrant Agreement, dated February 13, 2020, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;

 


●A
Rights Agreements, dated February 13, 2020, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company;


 


●Unit
Purchase Option, dated February 19, 2020, by and between the Company and Chardan;



 


●Letter
Agreements, dated February 13, 2020, by and between the Company’s officers, directors and shareholders;

 


●An
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated February 13, 2020, by and between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
and the Company;

 


●An
Escrow Agreement, dated February 13, 2020, by and among the Company, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and each of
the initial shareholders of the Company; and

 


●A
Registration Rights Agreement, dated February 13, 2020, by and among the Company and the initial shareholders of the Company.

 

On
February 19, 2020, the Company consummated the IPO of 5,750,000 units (the “Units”) (which includes full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option). Each Unit consists of one
ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half
of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth of one
Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000. 

 

As
of February 19, 2020, a total of $57,500,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were
deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. An audited balance sheet
as of February 19, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement will be filed
within 4 business days of the consummation of the IPO.

 

Item
3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with NeoGenesis Holding
Co. Ltd., the Company’s sponsor, of 272,500 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit,
generating total proceeds of $2,725,000.

 

The
Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO except that the warrants underlying the Private Units will be non-redeemable
and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their
permitted transferees. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or
underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the
Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights
in connection with the purchase of the Private Units.

 

The
Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve
a public offering. 

 

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On February 13, 2020, in connection with
the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Articles of Association with the Cayman Islands General Registry. The terms
of the Amended and Restated Articles of Association are set forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by
reference.
