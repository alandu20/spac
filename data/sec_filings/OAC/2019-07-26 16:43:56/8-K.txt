 Item 8.01. Other Events. 
On July 22, 2019, Oaktree Acquisition Corp. (the Company) consummated an initial public offering (the
IPO) of 20,125,000 units (the Units) at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit and a private placement with Oaktree Acquisition Holdings, L.P. of 4,016,667 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The net
proceeds from the IPO together with certain of the proceeds from the private placement, $201,250,000 in the aggregate (the Offering Proceeds), were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Companys public
shareholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal of interest to fund regulatory compliance requirements and other costs related thereto, subject to an
annual limit of $325,000, and/or to pay income taxes, or upon the redemption by public shareholders of Class A ordinary shares in connection with certain amendments to the Companys amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the completion of the Companys initial business combination or the redemption of 100% of the Class A ordinary shares, included in the Units and
issued by the Company in the IPO, if the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO. 
An audited balance sheet as of July 22, 2019 reflecting receipt of the Offering Proceeds has been issued by the Company
and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  Item 9.01. Financial
