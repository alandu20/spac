 Item 8.01. Other Events. 
On September 6, 2019, Oaktree Acquisition Corp. (the Company) announced that the holders of the Companys units (the
Units) may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class A Ordinary Shares), and warrants included in the Units commencing on September 9, 2019. Each Unit
consists of one Class A Ordinary Share and one-third of one warrant to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share. Any Units not separated will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange
(the NYSE) under the symbol OAC.U. Any underlying Class A Ordinary Shares and warrants that are separated are expected to trade on the NYSE under the symbols OAC and OAC WS, respectively. No
fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Companys transfer agent, in
order to separate the holders Units into Class A Ordinary Shares and warrants.  A copy of the press release issued by the
Company announcing the separate trading of the securities underlying the Units is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.  Item 9.01. Financial
Statements and Exhibits.
