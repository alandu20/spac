Item 5.02
 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  On October 1, 2019, Oaktree Acquisition Corp. (the
Company) appointed Mr. Zaid Pardesi as its Chief Financial Officer and Head of M&A, following the resignation of Alexander Taubman from his position as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Pardesis appointment will be
effective immediately. Mr. Taubman will remain President of the Company.  Mr. Pardesi is a senior vice president within
Oaktrees Value Equities strategy. He has spent his career originating, acquiring and managing middle-market companies in the industrial, consumer, and healthcare sectors, often operating platforms as CFO. Mr. Pardesi joined Oaktree in
2019 from The Cranemere Group, a global holding company, where he was a senior investment professional acquiring middle-market businesses. Prior thereto, Mr. Pardesi was an investor at H.I.G. Capital, where he
co-founded and co-led the Chicago office, and at AEA Investors in New York and London. He began his career at Bain & Company. Mr. Pardesi received an
M.B.A. from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and a B.S. from Northwestern University, where he was a computer engineering and economics double major. 
Mr. Pardesi will not be compensated by the Company for his services as Chief Financial Officer and has not entered into an employment
agreement with the Company.  Mr. Pardesi does not have a family relationship with any director or executive officer of the Company
and there are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Pardesi and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Pardesi was selected to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. There have been no transactions involving
Mr. Pardesi that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). In connection with this appointment,
Mr. Pardesi is expected to enter into an indemnity agreement and a letter agreement with the Company on the same terms as the indemnity agreements and letter agreements entered into by the directors and officers of the Company at the time of
the Companys initial public offering.
