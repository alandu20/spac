Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement

 

On May 26, 2020, the stockholders of Megalith
Financial Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) voted to approve the Trust Amendment Proposal (as defined below).
In connection with the approval of the Trust Amendment Proposal, the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
(the “Transfer Agent”) entered into the Amendment No. 1 to the Investment Management Trust Agreement (the “Amendment”)
a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The
Amendment extends the date on which the Trust Account (as defined below) must be liquidated if the Company has not completed an
initial business combination by 21 months from the closing of the IPO, which is May 28, 2020, to August 28, 2020 (or
November 30, 2020 if the Company has executed a definitive agreement for an initial business combination by August 28,
2020). All other terms of the Trust Agreement (as defined below) remain unchanged.

 

Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

 

On May 26, 2020, the Company
held a special meeting (the “Special Meeting”) of stockholders in lieu of the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.
At the Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved the following items: (i) an amendment to the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination (the “Extension”)
from May 28, 2020 to August 28, 2020 (or November 30, 2020 if the Company has executed a definitive agreement for an initial
business combination by August 28, 2020) (such date or later date, as applicable, the “Extended Date”)
(the “Extension Proposal”); (ii) a proposal to amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated August 23,
2018 (the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and the Transfer Agent to extend the date on which
the trust account (the “Trust Account”) established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering
(IPO) must be liquidated if the Company has not completed an initial business combination by 21 months from the closing
of the IPO, which is May 28, 2020, to the Extended Date (the “Trust Amendment Proposal”); and (iii) a
proposal to elect each of Messrs. Raj Date and Eric Frank as Class I directors of the Company with each such director to serve
until the second annual general meeting of stockholders following the Special Meeting or until his or her successor is elected
and qualified (the “Director Proposal”). The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 65% of the outstanding
shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock (collectively, the “Common Stock”),
voting as a single class, on the record date was required to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment
Proposal. The affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person online or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Director Proposal at the Special Meeting was required to elect each of
the two (2) nominees as Class I directors. The affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast by stockholders present
in person online or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal at the Special
Meeting is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.

 

Following redemptions of
13,733,885 of the shares of Class A common stock in connection with the Extension, a total of approximately $33,167,514.53 will
remain in the Trust Account.





 

Set
forth below are the final voting results for the Extension Proposal, the Trust amendment Proposal and the Director Proposal. The
Adjournment Proposal was not presented because there were enough votes to approve each of the Extension Proposal and the Trust
Amendment Proposal.
