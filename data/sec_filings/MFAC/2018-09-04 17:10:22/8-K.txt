Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

On
August 28, 2018, Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of 15,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common
stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one warrant of the Company
(“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for
$11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $150,000,000.
The Company has granted the underwriters for the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up to
2,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

On
August 28, 2018, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private
Placement”) of an aggregate of 6,560,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”). 5,810,000 of
the Private Placement Warrants were sold to MFA Investor Holdings LLC (the “Sponsor”) and 750,000 Private Placement
Warrants were sold to the Underwriters at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $6,560,000. The Sponsor has committed to purchase up to an additional 450,000 Private Placement Warrants if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full.

 

A
total of $151,500,000, comprised of $144,940,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $6,000,000 of the underwriters’
deferred discount) and $6,560,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of August 28, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement
has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
