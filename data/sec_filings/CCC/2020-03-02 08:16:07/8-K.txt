Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

 

On February 28, 2020, subsidiaries of
Clarivate Analytics Plc (“Clarivate” or the “Company”) entered into an incremental facility amendment
(the “Incremental Facility Amendment”) with Bank of America, N.A. and Citibank, N.A. to the subsidiaries’ existing
credit agreement dated as of October 31, 2019 (the “Credit Agreement”), pursuant to which certain borrowers thereunder borrowed $360.0
million in aggregate principal amount of incremental term loans. The terms of the incremental term loans are the same as
those applicable to the existing term loans under the Credit Agreement prior to effectiveness of the Incremental Facility
Amendment, as more fully described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019
under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Profile—Credit Facilities.” Proceeds of the
incremental term loans were used towards consummating the acquisition referred to under Item 2.01. The Incremental Facility
Amendment is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

 


Item 2.01.Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

 

On February 28, 2020, Clarivate announced
the closing of its acquisition of Decision Resources Group (“DRG”), a premier provider of high-value data, analytics
and insights products and services to the healthcare industry, from Piramal Enterprises Limited, part of global business conglomerate
Piramal Group. The DRG acquisition was first announced on January 17, 2020.

 

Clarivate acquired DRG for cash consideration
consisting of $900.0 million and expects to issue ordinary shares to the seller following the first anniversary of closing, as
described under Item 3.02. Approximately $540.0 million of the cash consideration was funded with the net proceeds of the Company’s
offering of 27.6 million ordinary shares, which closed on February 10, 2020, and the balance, together with funds covering fees
and expenses associated with the acquisition, was provided by the incremental term loans referred to under Item 1.01 and cash on
hand.

 

The share purchase agreement governing
the acquisition (the “DRG Acquisition Agreement”) is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

 


Item 2.03.Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement

 

The information set forth in Item 1.01
is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

 


Item 3.02.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

 

Pursuant to the DRG Acquisition Agreement,
the Company agreed to issue up to 2,895,638 ordinary shares to the seller as partial consideration for the DRG acquisition, to
be deferred until the first anniversary of closing. The number of ordinary shares to be issued is subject to adjustment pending
the resolution of certain claims against the seller, if any. As of January 17, 2020, the date of the DRG Acquisition Agreement,
the 2,895,638 ordinary shares were valued at approximately $50.0 million. The issuance of the ordinary shares is exempt from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. Under the
DRG Acquisition Agreement, Clarivate agreed to file a registration statement under the Securities Act in order to permit the seller
to dispose of such ordinary shares.

 


Item 8.01.Other Events

 

On March 2, 2020, Clarivate issued a press
release announcing closing of the DRG acquisition. A copy of the press release is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated
by reference herein.
