On August 13,
2019, Thunder Bridge Acquisition II, Ltd. (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (the
“IPO”) of 34,500,000 units (the “Units”), including 4,500,000 Units issued pursuant to
the exercise in full of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of
the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable
warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds to the Company of $345,000,000.



 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate
of 8,650,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Thunder Bridge Acquisition II LLC (the “Sponsor”)
at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,650,000.

 

A
total of $345,000,000, comprised of $338,100,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $12,075,000 of the underwriters’
deferred discount) and $6,900,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust
account, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of August 13, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement
has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
