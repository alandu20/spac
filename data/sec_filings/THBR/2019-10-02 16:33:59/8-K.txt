Separate Trading of Units, Class A Ordinary
Shares and Warrants

As previously reported,
on Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed on August 14, 2019 and August 19, 2019, Thunder Bridge Acquisition II, Ltd. (the “Company”)
consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of an aggregate of 34,500,000 units (the “Units”), including
4,500,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of
one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of
one redeemable warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds to the Company of approximately $345,000,000.

On October 2, 2019,
the Company issued a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, announcing
that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants comprising the Units
commencing on October 4, 2019. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol
“THBRU,” and the Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants that are separated will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market
under the symbols “THBR” and “THBRW,” respectively. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation
of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of the Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into Class A Ordinary Shares
and Warrants.
