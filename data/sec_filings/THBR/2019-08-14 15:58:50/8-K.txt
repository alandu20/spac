Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously with the
closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and the Sponsor, the
Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 8,650,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”)
to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,650,000.
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has
agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30
days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants are also not redeemable
by the Company so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. No underwriting discounts or commissions were
paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration
contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

of Association is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

and $6,900,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account, maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the
trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from
the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption
of any of the Company’s public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100%
