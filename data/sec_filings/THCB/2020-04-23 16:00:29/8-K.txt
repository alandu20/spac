Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive
Agreement.

 

The information included in Item 3.02 of this
Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities.

 

On April 20, 2020, Tuscan Holdings Acquisition
LLC (“Lender”), an affiliate of Stephen Vogel, the Chief Executive Officer of Tuscan Holdings Corp. (the “Company”),
committed to lend the Company an aggregate of $500,000 through December 7, 2020 (the “Commitment”) if such funds are
needed by the Company to consummate an initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination
with one or more businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Any amount loaned pursuant to the Commitment will
be evidenced by an unsecured promissory note issued to the Lender.

 

On April 21, 2020, the Lender made a loan in
the aggregate principal amount of $300,000 pursuant to the Commitment, which loan is evidenced by a promissory note (“Note”).
The Note is non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of a Business Combination. Upon consummation of a Business Combination,
the principal balance of the Note may be converted, at the holder’s option, into units of the post-Business Combination company
at a price of $10.00 per unit. The terms of the units will be identical to the units issued by the Company in its initial public
offering, except the warrants underlying the units will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case
so long as they continue to be held by the initial holder or its permitted transferees. If a Business Combination is not consummated,
the Note will not be repaid by the Company and all amounts owed thereunder by the Company will be forgiven except to the extent
that the Company has funds available to it outside of its trust account established in connection with the initial public offering
(the “Trust Account”). The issuance of the Note was exempt pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended.

 

The foregoing summaries of the Commitment and
Note are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the Commitment and Note, each of which are filed as exhibits hereto
and incorporated by reference herein.
