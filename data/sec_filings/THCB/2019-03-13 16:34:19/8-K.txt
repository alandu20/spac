    Item 8.01.
    Other Events.

 

On March 7, 2019,
the Company consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”) of 24,000,000 of its units (“Units”).
Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), and one redeemable
warrant (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price
of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $240,000,000.

	Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 615,000
Units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $6,150,000, to the
Company’s sponsor, Tuscan Holdings Acqusition LLC, and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in
the IPO, and its designees. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that the Warrants underlying the
Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by
the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the Private Units have agreed (A) to vote the Common Stock
underlying the Private Units (“Private Shares”) in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to convert
any Private Shares into the right to receive cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve the Company’s
proposed initial business combination or sell any Private Shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a proposed
initial business combination and (C) that such Private Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding
up if a business combination is not consummated within the required time period. Additionally, the purchasers of Private Units
have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units, including the underlying Common Stock and Warrants (except
to certain permitted transferees), until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.

	An audited balance
sheet as of March 7, 2019 reflecting receipt of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the consummation of the
IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
A copy of the press release issued by the Company announcing the consummation of the IPO and Private Placement is included as Exhibit
99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 



On March
12, 2019, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 3,600,000 Units that were subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment
option at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $36,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional
units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 72,000 Private Units at $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds
of $720,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Units, an aggregate amount of $276,000,000
has been placed in the Company’s trust account established in connection with the IPO.
