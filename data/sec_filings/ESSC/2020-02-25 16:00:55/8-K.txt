Item 1.01. Entry
into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

On
February 24, 2020, East Stone Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”)
of 12,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of the Company, no par value (the
“Ordinary Shares”), one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling
the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per whole share and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10)
of one ordinary share upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination. The Units were sold at a price of
$10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $120,000,000. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, dated February
19, 2020, the Company granted the underwriters in the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 30-day option to purchase
up to 1,800,000 additional Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-Allotment Option”). Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option in full.

 

In
connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the following agreements, some of which were forms previously filed as exhibits
to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-235949 and 333-236527) for the IPO, originally filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on January 17, 2020 (as amended, the “Registration
Statement”):

On
February 19, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 103,500 Ordinary Shares (the “Representative’s Shares”)
to I-Bankers and its designee, EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBird”), in connection with their services as underwriters
for the IPO and as a result of the full exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. I-Bankers and EarlyBird have agreed not to transfer,
assign or sell any of Representative’s Shares until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.
In addition, I-Bankers and EarlyBird have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection
with the completion of the Company’s initial business combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete its initial business combination within 15
months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if the Company extends the period
of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in the Registration Statement). Such Ordinary Shares
were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

 

On
February 24, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 690,000 warrants, exercisable at $12.00 per full share (the “Representative’s
Warrants”), to I-Bankers and its designee, EarlyBird, in connection with their services as underwriters for the IPO
and as a result of the full exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. The Representative’s Warrants may be exercised for cash
or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, at any time during the period commencing on the later of the first anniversary
of the effective date of the Registration Statement and the closing of the Company’s initial business combination and terminating
on the fifth anniversary of such effectiveness date. I-Bankers and EarlyBird have each agreed that neither it nor its designees
will be permitted to exercise the warrants after the five year anniversary of the effective date of the Registration Statement.
The Representative’s Warrants and such shares purchased pursuant to the Representative’s Warrants are subject to a
lock-up for a period of 360 days immediately following the date of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Representative’s
Warrants grant to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the
effective date of the Registration Statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the ordinary shares
issuable upon exercise of the Representative’s Warrants.

 

Item 3.02. Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities.

 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Unit Subscription Agreements, dated as February 20, 2020 (the “Private Placement
Agreements”), by and between each of Double Ventures Holdings Limited (the “Sponsor”), I-Bankers,
Hua Mao and Cheng Zhao, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, completed the private sale of an aggregate of 350,000
units (the “Private Placement Units”), at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating
gross proceeds to the Company of $3,500,000. Pursuant to the Private Placement Agreement, 167,000 Private Placement Units were
purchased by the Sponsor, an aggregate of 108,000 Private Placement Units were purchased by Hua Mao and Cheng Zhao separately
and not together, and 75,000 Private Placement Units were purchased by I-Bankers.

 

The
Private Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that warrants that are part of the Private Placement
Units are not redeemable by the Company so long as they are held by the original holders or their permitted transferees. In addition,
for as long as the warrants that are part of the Private Placement Units are held by I-Bankers or its designees or affiliates,
they may not be exercised after five years from the effective date of the Registration Statement. No underwriting discounts or
commissions were paid with respect to such sales. The issuance of the Private Placement Units was made pursuant to the exemption
from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2), Regulation D and/or Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”).

 

The
foregoing description of the Private Placement Agreements are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the full text of such agreements, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7 to this Current Report
on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

 

Item 5.03. Amendments
to Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 

On
February 19, 2020, in connection with the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
in the British Virgin Islands, effective the same day. The terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
are set forth in the Registration Statement and are incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Amended and Restated Memorandum
and Articles of Association is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

A
total of $138,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement Units was placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by CST, acting as trustee. Except with respect to the interest earned on the funds
in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the trust account will not be released
from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the
redemption of any of the Company’s public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100%
of the Company’s public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months
if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in the Registration
Statement) from the closing of the IPO or (iii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete
its initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months if the Company extends the period of time to consummate
a business combination, as described in more detail in the Registration Statement) from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable
law.

 

I-Bankers
and EarlyBird agreed to defer $402,500 in underwriting commission (the “Deferred Commission”) until the completion
of the Company’s initial business combination, if any, which Deferred Commission would be paid out of the trust account
to I-Bankers and EarlyBird. Such funds will be released only upon consummation of an initial business combination, as described
in the Registration Statement. If the business combination is not consummated, such Deferred Commission will be forfeited. None
of the underwriters will be entitled to any interest accrued on the Deferred Commission.

 

On February
19, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of the IPO, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1
to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
