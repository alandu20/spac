Item
1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

As
previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 25, 2020, East Stone Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) consummated its
initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 12,000,000 units (the “Units”) on February 24, 2020.
Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of the Company, no par value (the “Ordinary Shares”), one redeemable
warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of
one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per whole share and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon consummation
of the Company’s initial business combination (the “Business Combination”). The Units were sold at a
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $120,000,000 to the Company. Pursuant to an underwriting agreement,
dated as of February 19, 2020 (the “Underwriting Agreement”),
between the Company and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. (“I-Bankers”) as representative of the several underwriters
(the “Underwriters”), the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,800,000 additional
Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-Allotment Option”); and simultaneously with the consummation
of the IPO, the Underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option in full.

 

On
February 24, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed three private sales of an aggregate
of 350,000 Units (the “Placement Units”) to Double Ventures Holdings Limited, Hua Mao, Cheng Zhao and I-Bankers,
generating gross proceeds of $3,500,000 to the Company.

 

Pursuant
to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company and the initial shareholders of the Company (the “Initial Shareholders”)
entered into a share escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, as escrow agent, on March 4, 2020. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Initial Shareholders placed into escrow
and agreed not to transfer, assign or sell (except with respect to permitted transferees) 50% of the Ordinary Shares issued to
them prior the IPO (the “Founder Shares”) until the earlier of: (i) six months after the date of the consummation
of the Company’s initial Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals
or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20
trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after the Company’s initial Business Combination and the remaining
50% of the Founder Shares may not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date of the consummation of the
Company’s initial Business Combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to the initial Business Combination,
the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of
its shareholders having the right to exchange their Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property. The Placement Units
(including the underlying securities) that are owned by the Initial Shareholders were also placed into escrow and will not be
transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination (except
with respect to permitted transferees).

 

The
summary of the Escrow Agreement contained herein is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of such agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
