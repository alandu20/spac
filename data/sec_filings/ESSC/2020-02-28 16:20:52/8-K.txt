Item
8.01. Other Events.

 

As
previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K, East Stone Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”)
consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 12,000,000 units (the “Units”) on
February 24, 2020. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of the Company, no par value (the “Ordinary
Shares”), one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the
holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per whole share and one right to receive one-tenth
(1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination. The Units were sold at a
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $120,000,000 to the Company. Pursuant to an underwriting
agreement, dated as of February 19, 2020, between the Company and I-Bankers
Securities, Inc. as representative of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”), the Company granted
the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,800,000 additional Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the
“Over-Allotment Option”); and simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Underwriters exercised
the Over-Allotment Option in full, generating aggregate gross proceeds of $138,000,000.

 

On
February 24, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed three private sales (the “Private
Placements”) of an aggregate of 350,000 Units (the “Private Placement Units”) to Double Ventures
Holdings Limited, Hua Mao, Cheng Zhao and I-Bankers, generating gross proceeds of $3,500,000 to the Company.

 

A
total of $138,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement Units was placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

 

An
audited balance sheet as of February 24, 2020 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private
Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
