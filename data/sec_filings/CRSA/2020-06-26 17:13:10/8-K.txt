 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
Sponsor Support Agreement  On June 24, 2020,
Crescent Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation (the Company), in connection with its proposed business combination (the Business Combination) with F45 Training Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (F45),
entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement (the Sponsor Support Agreement), by and among the Company, F45, CFI Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the sponsor of the Company (the Sponsor), and each of the
parties set forth on Schedule A therein (each such person and the Sponsor, a Supporting Party). Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, each Supporting Party agrees to, among other things, certain restrictions on the transfer of
Company securities owned or beneficially owned by such Supporting Party or acquired thereafter, vote Company securities owned or beneficially owned by such Supporting Party in favor of the approval of the Business Combination and other proposals
related to the Business Combination, refrain from redeeming Company securities owned or beneficially owned by such Supporting Party and waive certain other rights associated with the ownership or beneficial ownership of Company securities by such
Supporting Party. The Sponsor also agrees to, upon the closing of the Business Combination, subject some of the Company securities owned by it to a five year lock-up period during which the transfer of such
securities will be restricted, with such restrictions subject to release during the lock-up period if the price of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market exceeds certain thresholds. Any
securities subject to and not released during the lock-up period will be forfeited.  The foregoing description of the Sponsor Support Agreement does not
