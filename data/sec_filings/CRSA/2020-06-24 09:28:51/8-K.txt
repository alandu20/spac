Item 1.01
 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
On June 24, 2020, Crescent Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation (the Company), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, Function Acquisition I Corp, a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (First Merger Sub), Function Acquisition II LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (Second Merger Sub), F45 Training Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (F45), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability
company, which provides for, among other things: (a) the merger of First Merger Sub with and into F45, with F45 being the surviving corporation of the merger and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as a consequence of the merger
(the First Merger); and (b) immediately following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, the merger of F45 with and into Second Merger Sub, with Second Merger Sub being the surviving
corporation of the merger (together with the First Merger, the Mergers and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination). 
The Merger Agreement  Merger Consideration
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate merger consideration payable to the stockholders of F45 will consist of (assuming no redemptions):
(a) an amount in cash equal to the Closing Cash Payment Amount (as defined in the Merger Agreement), which is expected to be approximately $202 million; and (b) shares of newly-issued Class A common stock of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share (Class A Stock), equal to the Closing Number of Securities (as defined in the Merger Agreement), which are expected to have a value of approximately $526 million based on a price of $10 per share. The
merger consideration payable to the stockholders of F45 is also subject to adjustment based on F45s cash and indebtedness as of the closing date, among other adjustments contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
In addition to the consideration to be paid at the closing of the Business Combination, the stockholders of F45 will be entitled to receive additional earn-out payments from the Company of up to an aggregate of 5 million shares of Class B common stock of the Company (Class B Stock), consisting of shares of Class B-1 common stock of the
Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and shares of Class B-2 common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, plus 5 million shares of Class C common stock of the Company (Class C Stock), consisting of shares of Class
C-1 common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and shares of Class C-2 common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, such Class B Stock and Class C Stock to become convertible into Class A Stock if the price
of Class A common stock trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market exceeds certain thresholds during the five-year period following the closing of the Business Combination. As an incentive for F45 to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
Companys sponsor, CFI Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor), has agreed that 1,250,000 shares of Class A Stock held by it immediately following the closing of the Business Combination (following the
automatic conversion of such shares upon the closing of the Business Combination from shares of Class F common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, into shares of Class A Stock) will be subject to the release of restrictions
on transfer only if the price of Class A Stock trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market exceeds the same thresholds during the five-year period following the closing of the Business Combination. 








 Representations, Warranties and Covenants 
The parties to the Merger Agreement have made representations, warranties and covenants that are customary for transactions of this nature. The representations
and warranties of the respective parties to the Merger Agreement will not survive the closing of the transaction.  Conditions to Consummation of the
Transaction  Consummation of the Business Combination is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the Companys stockholders
and the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board as well as expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. In addition, each of the Companys and F45s obligation to consummate the
Business Combination is subject to the Companys total cash proceeds, which includes, among other things, the cash available to the Company from its trust account and the proceeds from the Forward Purchase Agreement (as defined below), equaling
or exceeding $225 million.  Termination  The Merger
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (whether before or after the required Company stockholder vote has been obtained) by mutual written agreement of the Company and F45 and in certain other
circumstances, including if the Business Combination has not been consummated by December 24, 2020 and the delay in closing beyond such date is not due to the breach of the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate, which date may be
extended to February 24, 2021 in case all conditions to consummate the Business Combination have been satisfied other than regulatory conditions or extended to a limited extent in case of government shutdowns. 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Mergers, does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that
the respective parties made to each other as of the date of such agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and
are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not
intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or any other party to the Merger Agreement. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which were made only for
purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by confidential
disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts) and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that
differ from those applicable to the Companys investors and security holders. Company investors and security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change
after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Companys public disclosures. 








 Forward Purchase Agreement 
As previously disclosed by the Company, on February 26, 2019, the Company entered into that certain Forward Purchase Agreement with Crescent
Capital Group LP (Crescent), an affiliate of the Sponsor, in Crescents capacity as investment advisor to one or more investment funds or accounts managed by Crescent and its affiliates. 
On June 24, 2020, Crescent and the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Agreement (the Forward Purchase Agreement),
pursuant to which Crescent has committed to purchase from the Company, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, 5,000,000 shares of Class A Stock plus 1,666,6662⁄3 redeemable warrants of the Company (the Warrants), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, for an aggregate
purchase price of $50 million in a private placement that will close immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination. The securities issued pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement will be subject to a lock-up period during which
the transfer of such securities will be restricted.  The foregoing description of the Forward Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Forward Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
