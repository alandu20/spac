 Item 8.01 Other Events 
On March 12, 2019, Crescent Acquisition Corp (the Company) consummated its initial public offering (the Initial Public
Offering) of 25,000,000 units (the Units). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class A Common Stock), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per
unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000.  Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company completed the
private sale of 7,000,000 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, to the Companys sponsor, CFI Sponsor LLC, generating gross proceeds to the Company of
$7,000,000.  A total of $250,000,000, comprised of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, including
$8,750,000 of the underwriters deferred underwriting fee, were placed in a U.S.-based trust with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. An audited balance sheet as of March 12, 2019 reflecting receipt of
the proceeds upon consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
