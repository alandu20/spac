            Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
          
        

    
    
    
    On May 15, 2020, AMCI Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Meeting”). At the
      Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) extending the date by which the Company must consummate its
      initial business combination from May 20, 2020 to October 20, 2020, or such earlier date as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Extension Amendment Proposal”).
    
    
    The final voting results for the Extension Amendment Proposal were as follows:

    Stockholders holding 7,126,888 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s trust account (“Trust Account”). As a result, approximately $72.6 million (approximately $10.18 per share) will be removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Approximately
        $373,000 (equal to $0.025 for each share of Class A common stock that was not redeemed at the Meeting) will be deposited into the Trust Account for each calendar month, or portion
        thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete an initial business combination.
    
    
    The Company intends to file the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on or prior to May 20, 2020.
