      On November 20, 2018, AMCI Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”)






          consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit
          consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per
          Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $200,000,000. The Company has granted the underwriters for the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up
          to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any.
       
      
      On November 20, 2018, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 5,500,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to
          AMCI Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,500,000. The Sponsor has
          committed to purchase up to an additional 600,000 Private Placement Warrants if the Underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full.
       
      
      A total of $200,000,000, comprised of $196,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $7,000,000 of the underwriters’
          deferred discount) and $4,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as
          trustee.
       
      
      An audited balance sheet as of November 20, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the IPO and the Private
          Placement has been issued by the Company and is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
