      As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K of AMCI Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), on November 20, 2018, the Company consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “ Class A Common Stock ”), and one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of
          Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $200,000,000. The Company had granted the underwriters for the IPO (the “Underwriters”) a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any (“Over-Allotment Units”).




          On November 27, 2018, the Underwriters exercised the option in part and purchased an aggregate of 2,052,077 Over-Allotment Units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $20,520,770.
       
      
      As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company, on November 20, 2018, simultaneously with the consummation of
          the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 5,500,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to AMCI Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating
          gross proceeds to the Company of $5,500,000. On November 27, 2018, in connection with the sale of Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 410,416 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor, generating gross
          proceeds of $410,416.
       
      
      In addition, the 5,750,000 shares of Class B common stock of the Company (the “Founder Shares”) held by the Sponsor (prior to the exercise of the over-allotment) included an aggregate of up to 750,000 Founder Shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the Underwriters’
          over-allotment option was not exercised in full. Since the Underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part, the Sponsor forfeited 236,981 Founder Shares on November 27, 2018. The Founder Shares forfeited by the Sponsor were cancelled by
          the Company.
       
      
      A total of $220,520,770, (or $10.00 per Unit) comprised of $216,110,354 of the proceeds from the IPO (including the Over-Allotment
          Units) and $4,410,416 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
       
      
      An audited balance sheet as of November 20, 2018 reflecting receipt of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement on
          November 20, 2018, but not the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units nor the Private Placement on November 27, 2018, had been prepared by the Company and previously filed on a Current Report on Form 8-K on November 27, 2018. The
          Company’s unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of November 27, 2018, reflecting receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the Private Placement on the same day is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form
          8-K.
      
      
      On November 27, 2018, the Company issued a press release announcing the consummation of the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, a copy
          of which is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
