securities litigation reform act of 1995. collier creek’s and utz’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, collier creek’s and utz’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the proposed business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside collier creek’s and utz’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against collier creek and utz following the announcement of the business combination agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the proposed business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of collier creek or other conditions to closing in the business combination agreement; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (5) the amount of redemption requests made by collier creek’s shareholders; (6) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the post-business combination company’s common stock on the new york stock exchange following the proposed business combination; (7) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts current plans and operations; (8) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (9) costs related to the proposed business combination; (10) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (11) the possibility that utz or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the proposed business combination, including those included in the section “risk factors”, and in collier creek’s other filings with the sec. some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by the covid-19 outbreak and there may be additional risks that collier creek considers immaterial or which are unknown. it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. collier creek cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. collier creek cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. collier creek does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as otherwise required by law. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

litigation reform act of 1995. collier creek’s and utz’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, collier creek’s and utz’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the proposed business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside collier creek’s and utz’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against collier creek and utz following the announcement of the business combination agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the proposed business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of collier creek or other conditions to closing in the business combination agreement; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (5) the amount of redemption requests made by collier creek’s shareholders; (6) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the post-business combination company’s common stock on the new york stock exchange following the proposed business combination; (7) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts current plans and operations; (8) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (9) costs related to the proposed business combination; (10) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (11) the possibility that utz or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the proposed business combination, including those included in the section “risk factors”, and in collier creek’s other filings with the sec. some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by the covid-19 outbreak and there may be additional risks that collier creek considers immaterial or which are unknown. it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. collier creek cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. collier creek cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. collier creek does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as otherwise required by law. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forum and tattooed chef’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, forum’s and tattooed chef’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside forum’s and tattooed chef’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against forum or tattooed chef following the announcement of the merger agreement and the business combination; (3) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of forum or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) the receipt of an unsolicited offer from another party for an alternative business transaction that could interfere with the business combination; (5) the inability to obtain the listing of the ordinary shares of the post-acquisition company on the nasdaq stock market or any alternative national securities exchange following the business combination; (6) the risk that the announcement and consummation of the business combination disrupts current plans and operations; (7) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (8) costs related to the business combination; (9) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (10) the possibility that tattooed chef may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (11) the impact of covid-19 on the combined company’s business; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement to be filed relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and in forum’s other filings with the sec. some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by the covid-19 outbreak and there may be additional risks that forum considers immaterial or which are unknown. forum cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. forum cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. forum does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k shall not constitute a solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the business combination. this current report on form 8-k shall also not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to

ii corporation, 1615 south congress avenue, suite 103, delray beach, fl 33445, attention: secretary, telephone: (212) 739-7860. additional information regarding the interests of such participants will be contained in the proxy statement for the business combination when available. ittella parent and its directors and executive officers may also be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of forum in connection with the business combination. a list of the names of such directors and executive officers and information regarding their interests in the business combination will be included in the proxy statement for the business combination when available. 1 forward-looking statements this current report on form 8-k includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forum and ittella parent’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, forum’s and ittella parent’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside forum’s and ittella parent’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against forum or ittella parent following the announcement of the merger agreement and the business combination; (3) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of forum or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) the receipt of an unsolicited offer from another party for an alternative business transaction that could interfere with the business combination; (5) the inability to obtain the listing of the ordinary shares of the post-acquisition company on the nasdaq stock market or any alternative national securities exchange following the business combination; (6) the risk that the announcement and consummation of the business combination disrupts current plans and operations; (7) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (8) costs related to the business combination; (9) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (10) the possibility that ittella parent may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (11) the impact of covid-19 on the combined company’s business; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement to be filed relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and in forum’s other filings with the sec. some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by the covid-19 outbreak and there may be additional risks that forum considers immaterial or which are unknown. forum cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. forum cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. forum does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k shall not constitute a solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the business combination. this current report on form 8-k shall also not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any states or jurisdictions in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. no offering of securities shall be made except by means of a

contemporaneously with the closing, it will repurchase and cancel shares of velodyne capital stock from such shareholders in exchange for an aggregate amount of cash not to exceed $50,000,000. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, graf is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the common stock to be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the “transactions”) to be approved for listing on the new york stock exchange (“nyse”) prior to the closing. following the closing, graf agreed to comply with the terms of any

give rise to or result in any business combination (as defined in the merger agreement) other than with velodyne, its shareholders and their affiliates or representatives. graf change in recommendation graf is required to use its reasonable best efforts to include in the proxy statement the recommendation of graf’s board of directors to graf’s stockholders that they approve the transaction proposals (the “graf board recommendation”). graf is permitted to change the graf board recommendation (such change, a “change in recommendation”) if it determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such a change in recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. conditions to closing

as of a specified date, are modified or qualified by information in one or more confidential disclosure letters prepared in connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties. accordingly, the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are not necessarily characterizations of the actual state of facts about graf, velodyne or the other parties thereto at the time they were made or otherwise and should only be read in conjunction with the other information that graf makes publicly available in reports, statements and other documents filed with the sec. support

agreement, regardless of whether the merger is no longer recommended by the velodyne board of directors in accordance with the merger agreement. the shares of velodyne common stock that are owned by mr. hall or with respect to which mr. hall has the right to vote by proxy, all of which are subject to the support agreement, represent a majority of the outstanding voting power of velodyne. in

meeting to be presented for graf stockholder approval. the sponsor agreement amends and restates, with respect to the sponsor, the sponsor’s existing letter agreement, dated october 15, 2018 (the “existing sponsor agreement”), but will automatically revert to the existing sponsor agreement if the merger agreement is validly terminated. pursuant to the sponsor agreement, the sponsor will forfeit 3,519,128 founder shares and all of the private placement warrants (as defined in the sponsor agreement), in each case for no consideration, immediately prior to (but conditioned and effective upon) completion of the merger. following completion of the merger, the sponsor will retain 2,507,000 founder shares, 275,000 of which shall be earnout founder shares (as defined in the sponsor agreement). the sponsor agreement also provides that all earnout founder shares shall be subject to the performance vesting condition described below. the sponsor has agreed not to transfer any unvested earnout founder shares prior to the date such securities become vested. pursuant to the sponsor agreement, 100% of the earnout founder shares shall vest at such time as a $15.00 stock price level (as defined below) is achieved on or before the date that is six (6) months after the date of the merger. any earnout founder shares that do not vest on or prior to such date shall be forfeited. the sponsor agreement provides that the sponsor will not redeem any founder shares in connection with the merger. the sponsor has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer any founder shares or any private placement warrants (as defined in the sponsor agreement) (or any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) until the earlier of (a) one year after the completion of the merger and (b) subsequent to the merger, either (i) the achievement of a $12.00 stock price level (provided that the applicable thirty (30) day trading day period commences at least 150 days after the merger) or (ii) the date on which graf completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or similar transaction that results in all of graf’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property (the “lock-up period”). the applicable “stock price level” will be considered achieved only when the closing price of common stock on the new york stock exchange is greater than or equal to the applicable threshold for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period. the stock price levels will be equitably adjusted for any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event affecting the common stock after the date of the merger agreement. the sponsor agreement shall terminate on the expiration of the lock-up period; provided, however, that if the merger agreement is validly terminated, the sponsor agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no force and effect and, with respect to the sponsor, shall revert to the existing sponsor agreement. subscription agreements in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, the company entered into subscription agreements (the “subscription agreements”), each dated as of july 2, 2020, with certain institutional investors,

combination, an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share to the investors (including 950,000 shares to the sponsor), for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000,000. the sponsor owns approximately 34.3% of the outstanding shares of common stock and certain members of the company's management are members of the sponsor. the obligations to consummate the subscriptions are conditioned upon, among other things, there being at least $50,000,000 remaining in the company's trust account on the closing date after taking into account redemptions by the company's public stockholders (if any) and certain customary closing conditions and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. item 3.02 unregistered sales of equity securities. the

i warrants to purchase 600,000 ordinary shares of hl. the founders will also agree to forfeit up to an aggregate of up to 579,364 ordinary shares of hl, with the number of shares to be forfeited to be determined based on the amount of cash remaining in hl’s trust account after deducting all amounts to be paid to hl’s shareholders exercising their conversion rights and after adding all amounts raised by or on behalf of hl in private financings (with half of the shares forfeited by the founders to be cancelled and the other half of such shares to be transferred to the seller). cancellation of unit purchase options earlybirdcapital has agreed to enter into an amendment (“upo amendment”) on behalf of itself and the other holders of unit purchase options of hl issued in hl’s initial public offering to exchange the unit purchase options for 50,000 ordinary shares of hl at the closing of the business combination (the “closing”). amendment of hl warrants upon the approval of the holders of hl’s currently outstanding warrants, hl will enter into a warrant amendment agreement pursuant to which each outstanding warrant will represent the right to receive 0.1 of an ordinary share of hl on the closing date, rather than being exercisable to purchase one ordinary share of hl (the “warrant amendment”). hl has agreed to call a meeting of the holders of outstanding warrants in connection with the transaction and recommend that such warrant holders vote in favor of the warrant amendment, which is a condition to the closing. 1 indemnification the agreement provides for mutual indemnification by the seller and hl for breaches of their respective representations, warranties and covenants. claims for indemnification may be asserted once damages exceed a $2.5 million threshold and will be reimbursable to the full extent of the damages from the first dollar. claims for indemnification must be brought before the earlier of (i) 30 days after hl files its annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ending december 31, 2021 and (ii) april 1, 2022. to provide a source of funds for seller’s indemnification of hl, 116,250 of the purchase shares (the “escrow shares”) will be deposited into escrow with continental stock transfer & trust company acting as escrow agent. to provide a source of funds for hl’s indemnification of seller, hl will reserve for issuance an additional 116,250 ordinary shares of hl (the “indemnification pool”). other than with respect to actual fraud or intentional or willful misrepresentation or omission or, each of hl’s and seller’s right to indemnification will be its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for money damages arising out of or relating to the agreement. the escrow shares will provide the sole source of funds for hl’s indemnification right and the indemnification pool will provide the sole source of funds for seller’s indemnification right. the business combination is expected to be consummated in

(leo) announced that leo and dms entered into a business combination agreement (the business combination agreement). on june 23, 2020, the company received a letter (the shareholder letter) from a purported shareholder of leo claiming certain allegedly material omissions in the preliminary proxy statement filed on june 22, 2020 by leo (the proxy statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement (the business combination). while leo believes that the disclosures set forth in the proxy statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot the plaintiffs disclosure claims in the shareholder letter, to avoid nuisance, cost and distraction, and to preclude any efforts to delay the closing of the business combination, leo has determined to voluntarily supplement the proxy statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the supplemental disclosures). nothing in the supplemental disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. to the contrary, leo specifically denies all allegations in the shareholder letter that any additional disclosure was or is required. leo believes the shareholder letter is without merit. supplemental disclosures to proxy statement the following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the proxy statement, which should be read in its entirety. all page references are to pages in the proxy statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the proxy statement. underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the proxy statement. the following disclosure replaces the first paragraph on page 120 of the proxy statement under the heading background of the business combination. in the process that led to identifying dms as an attractive investment opportunity, leos management team evaluated over 65 potential business combination targets, entered into non-disclosure agreements with approximately 32 potential business combination targets (other than dms), and submitted non-binding indications of interest or letters of intent with respect to 15 potential business combination targets (other than dms). such non-disclosure agreements contained customary terms for a special purpose acquisition company and a private company target, including confidentiality provisions and use restrictions for information provided by the target and exceptions to such provisions. the following disclosure replaces the first paragraph on page 123 of the proxy statement under the heading background of the business combination. from and after march 27, 2020, the parties continued to negotiate the business combination agreement and the related ancillary agreements. in the context of negotiating the director nomination agreement, the parties agreed that lyndon lea and robert darwent would remain on the board of directors of new dms and that mary minnick would be appointed as the independent stockholder director (as defined in the director nomination agreement). each of lyndon lea, robert darwent and mary minnick are current directors of leo. the remainder of the leo board and leos officers will no longer serve as directors or officers, and will not otherwise be employees of new dms, upon consummation of the business combination. the following disclosure replaces the first paragraph on page 129 of the proxy statement under the heading background of the business combination. based on the financial analysis of dms generally used to approve the transaction (including the review of dmss historical financial results, outlook, financial plan and debt structure, as well as valuations and trading of publicly traded companies and valuations of precedent merger and acquisition targets in similar and adjacent sectors, and the review of financial due diligence materials prepared by professional advisors, including quality of earnings reports and tax due diligence reports), the leo board of directors determined that this requirement was met. additional information in connection with the business combination, leo has filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commissions (sec) a registration statement on form s-4 (the registration statement) and mailed a definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to its shareholders. this communication is not a substitute for the registration statement, the definitive proxy statement/prospectus or any other document that leo will send to its shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement (the business combination). investors and security holders of leo are advised to read the definitive proxy statement/prospectus in connection with leos solicitation of proxies for its extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held to approve the business combination (and related matters) because the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the business combination and the parties to the business combination. the definitive proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to shareholders of leo as of june 24, 2020, the record date established for voting on the business combination. shareholders are also be able to obtain copies of the definitive proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, at the secs website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: leo holdings corp., 21 grosvenor place, london sw1x 7hf, united kingdom. participants in the solicitation leo and its directors, executive officers, other members of management, and employees, under sec rules, may

regarding the names and interests in the business combination of leos directors and officers in leos filings with the sec, including leos annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended

modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules which are not filed publicly and which are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to shareholders and were used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. we do not believe that these schedules contain information that is material to an investment decision. sponsor shares and warrant surrender agreement concurrent with the execution of the business combination agreement, sponsor, leo and certain holders of class b ordinary shares of leo entered into a sponsor shares and warrant surrender agreement (the surrender agreement), pursuant to which (a) the surrender will be effectuated in connection with the consummation of the business combination and (b) sponsor and other holders party thereto agreed to waive any adjustment to the conversion ratio set forth in leos amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or any other anti-dilution or similar protection with respect to the class b ordinary shares of leo held by them. a copy of the surrender agreement is attached as exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the surrender agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. private placement leo entered into subscription agreements (the subscription agreements) with certain investors, pursuant to which, among other things, such investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and leo agreed to issue and sell to such investors, including funds managed by lion capital llp, an affiliate of the sponsor, immediately following the domestication, an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of class a shares for $10.00 per share, which will generate aggregate proceeds of $100.0 million (the private placement). the closing of the private placement is contingent upon, among other things, the substantially concurrent consummation of the business combination. the subscription agreements provide that new dms will grant the investors in the private placement certain customary registration rights. the class a shares to be offered and sold in connection with the private placement have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the securities act), in reliance upon the exemption provided in section 4(a)(2) of the securities act and/or regulation d or regulation s promulgated thereunder without any form of general solicitation or general advertising. the foregoing description of the subscription agreements and private placement is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of subscription agreement, a copy of which is attached as exhibit 10.2 hereto and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. additional information in connection with the business combination, leo intends to file with the u.s. securities and exchange commissions (sec) a registration statement on form s-4 (the registration statement), which will include a preliminary prospectus and preliminary proxy statement. leo will mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to its shareholders. this communication is not a substitute for the registration statement, the definitive proxy statement/prospectus or any other document that leo will send to its shareholders in connection with the business combination. investors and security holders of leo are advised to read, when available, the proxy statement/prospectus in connection with leos solicitation of proxies for its extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held to approve the business combination (and related matters) because the proxy statement/prospectus will contain important information about the business combination and the parties to the business combination. the definitive proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to shareholders of leo as of a record date to be established for voting on the business combination. shareholders will also be able to obtain copies of the proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, once available, at the secs website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: leo holdings corp., 21 grosvenor place, london sw1x 7hf, united kingdom. participants in the solicitation leo and its directors, executive officers, other members of management, and employees, under sec rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of leos shareholders in connection with the business combination. investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names and interests in the business combination of leos directors and officers in leos filings with the sec, including leos annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, which was filed with the sec on march 13, 2020, as well as in the registration statement, which will include the proxy statement of leo for the business combination. shareholders can obtain copies of leos filings with the sec, without charge, at the secs website at www.sec.gov. forward-looking statements this communication includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. leos and dmss actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as expect, estimate, project, budget, forecast, anticipate, intend, plan, may, will, could, should, believes, predicts, potential, continue, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, leos and dmss expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the proposed business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside leos and dmss control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement, (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against leo and dms following the announcement of the business combination agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the proposed business combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of leo or other conditions to closing in the business combination agreement; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (5) the amount of redemption requests made by leos shareholders; (6) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the post-business combination companys common stock on the new york stock exchange following the proposed business combination; (7) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the proposed business combination; (8) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (9) costs related to the proposed business combination; (10) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (11) the possibility that dms or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (12) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement relating to the proposed business combination, including those under risk factors in the registration statement, and in leos other filings with the sec. some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by the covid-19 outbreak and there may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. leo cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. leo cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. leo does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. no offer or solicitation this communication is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, subscribe for or buy any securities or the solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction pursuant to the business combination or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer or securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. no offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10 of the securities act and otherwise in accordance with applicable law. item 9.01 financial statements and exhibits.

(the form of which is an exhibit to the transaction agreement) pursuant to which it will agree not to transfer its shares for a period of 180 days from closing, subject to certain exceptions. business combination consideration in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the transaction agreement (the business combination), the consideration to be received by the equityholders of queso in connection with the transaction contemplated under the transaction agreement, which is conditioned upon the surrender of 1,750,000 shares by the sponsor, shall consist of: (i) 36,000,137 shares of the common stock of leo after the domestication (new leo common stock) (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share) and (ii) the right to receive up to an additional 4 million shares of new leo common stock upon the occurrence of certain events and subject to certain restrictions. cash held in the trust account net of redemptions and the gross proceeds of the private placement (the cash proceeds) less the transaction costs of the business combination will be used to pay down certain indebtedness of queso at the closing of the transaction. representations and warranties, covenants, and indemnification under the transaction agreement, parties to the agreement made customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type regarding themselves. certain fundamental representations and warranties of queso and the seller made under the transaction agreement (the fundamental representations) survive for four years following the closing of the business combination while all other representations and warranties made by the parties do not survive the closing. in addition, the parties to the transaction agreement made covenants that are customary for transactions of this type. the transaction agreement provides for the indemnification of leo by the seller with respect to breaches of the fundamental representations and covenants up to a cap of the consideration received by the seller pursuant to the merger (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share). conditions to each partys obligations consummation of the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement

expired or been terminated; (ii) the consummation of the surrender, domestication and private placement, (iii) there has been no material adverse effect to the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of queso and its subsidiaries, (iv) the requisite approvals have been obtained from leos stockholders, (v) the new leo common stock to be issued as consideration for the business combination has been approved for listing on the new york stock exchange and (vi) the aggregate amount of the cash proceeds is no less than $250 million. termination the transaction agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances at any time prior to the closing, including (i) if the closing has not occurred by september 13, 2019 (the outside date), unless because of the delay and/or nonperformance of the party seeking such termination, (ii) if leos board of directors changes its recommendation with respect to the transactions contemplated by the agreement and (iii) if leos stockholders do not approve the business combination and related proposals to be presented to them at a meeting of leos stockholders. if the transaction agreement is validly terminated, none of the parties will have any liability or any further obligation under the transaction agreement with certain limited exceptions, including liability arising out of a partys intentional breach (as defined in the transaction agreement) of any provision contained in the transaction agreement. a copy of the transaction agreement is filed with this current report on form 8-k as exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the transaction agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. the transaction agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of the transaction agreement or other specific dates. the assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. the representations, warranties and covenants in the transaction agreement are also modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules which are not filed publicly and which are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to stockholders and were used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. we do not believe that these schedules contain information that is material to an investment decision. private placement transactions concurrently with the execution of the transaction agreement, leo entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (collectively, the private placement investors) pursuant to which, among other things, such investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase and leo agreed to issue and sell to such investors, including funds managed by lion capital llp, immediately following the domestication (as defined above), 10,700,000 shares of leos common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, in each case, for an aggregate of up to $100.0 million (the private placement). as a result of the sponsor surrendering 1,750,000 shares to leo upon closing, the net effect is that the private placement is not dilutive to a $10 per share valuation of leo. the closing of the private placement is contingent upon, among other things, the substantially concurrent consummation of the proposed business combination and related transactions (the business combination). in connection with the private placement, leo will grant the private placement investors certain customary registration rights. the leo shares to be offered and sold in connection with the private placements have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the securities act), in reliance upon the exemption provided in section 4(a)(2) of the securities act and/or regulation d or regulation s promulgated thereunder without any form of general solicitation or general advertising. the form of subscription agreement is attached as exhibit 10.2 hereto. item 7.01 regulation fd

prospectus and preliminary proxy statement. leo will mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to its shareholders. investors and security holders of leo are advised to

report on form 8-k includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. monocle’s and aersale’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, monocle’s and aersale’s expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the business combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the business combination and the timing of the completion of the business combination. these forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. most of these factors are outside monocle’s and aersale’s control and are difficult to predict. factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or could otherwise cause the business combination to fail to close; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against monocle and aersale following the announcement of the merger agreement and the business combination; (3) the inability to complete the business combination, including due to failure to obtain approvals from the stockholders of monocle and aersale or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (4) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the shares of common stock of the post-acquisition company on the nasdaq stock market following the business combination; (5) the risk that the business combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the business combination; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (7) costs related to the business combination; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the possibility that aersale or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (10) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the business combination, including those under “risk factors” therein, and in monocle’s other filings with the sec. monocle cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. monocle further cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. monocle does not undertake to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based unless required to do so under applicable law. no offer or solicitation this current report on form 8-k is not a proxy statement or solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the proposed business combination and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale

“potential,” “seem,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. these forward-looking

timing of various business milestones, and projected business model and related assumptions; nebula’s ability to consummate a transaction with the company; nebula’s ability to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the proposed transactions; and the expected timing of completion of the proposed transactions. these statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of nebula’s and the company’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of nebula and the company. these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, financial, legal, political and business conditions and changes in domestic and foreign markets; the potential effects of covid-19; the outcome of judicial proceedings to which the company is, or may become a party; the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the proposed transactions or to satisfy the other conditions to the closing of the proposed transactions, including the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the combined company; the risk that the approval of the stockholders and warrantholders of nebula for the proposed transactions is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transactions, including as a result of a delay in consummating the proposed transaction or difficulty in, or costs associated with, integrating the businesses of nebula and the company; the amount of redemption requests made by nebula’s stockholders; the occurrence of events that may give rise to a right of one or both of nebula and the company to terminate the business combination agreement; risks related to the rollout of the company’s business and the timing of expected business milestones; changes in the assumptions underlying the company’s expectations regarding its future business or business model; the availability of capital; the effects of competition on the company’s future business; and those factors discussed in the proxy statement under the heading “risk factors,” and other documents of nebula filed, or to be filed, with the sec. if the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither nebula nor the company presently do not know or that nebula and the company currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect nebula’s and the company’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this current report on form 8-k. nebula and the company anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause their assessments to change. however, while nebula and the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, nebula and the company specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing nebula’s or the company’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this current report on form 8-k. accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. item 9.01. financial statements and exhibits.

8-k includes certain statements that are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the united states private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “seem,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. these

expectations, timing of various business milestones, and projected business model and related assumptions; nebula’s ability to consummate a transaction with the company; nebula’s ability to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the proposed transactions; and the expected timing of completion of the proposed transactions. these statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of nebula’s and the company’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of nebula and the company. these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, financial, legal, political and business conditions and changes in domestic and foreign markets; the potential effects of covid-19; the outcome of judicial proceedings to which the company is, or may become a party; the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the proposed transactions or to satisfy the other conditions

affect the combined company; the risk that the approval of the stockholders and warrantholders of nebula for the proposed transactions is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transactions, including as a result of a delay in consummating the proposed transaction or difficulty in, or costs associated with, integrating the businesses of nebula and the company;

agreement; risks related to the rollout of the company’s business and the timing of expected business milestones; changes in the assumptions underlying the company’s expectations regarding its future business or business model; the availability of capital; the effects of competition on the company’s future business; and those factors discussed in the registration statement under the heading “risk factors,” and other documents of nebula filed, or to be filed, with the sec. if the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither nebula nor the company presently do not know or that nebula and the company currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect nebula’s and the company’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this current report on form 8-k. nebula and the company anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause their assessments to change. however, while nebula and the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, nebula and the company specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing nebula’s or the company’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this current report on form 8-k. accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. 3 non-gaap financial measure and related information this current report on form 8-k references ebitda and ebitda margin, which are

nebula’s ability to consummate a transaction with the company; nebula’s ability to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the proposed transactions; and the expected timing of completion of the proposed transactions. these statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of nebula’s and the company’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of nebula and the company. these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, financial, legal, political and business conditions and changes in domestic and foreign markets; the potential effects of covid-19; the outcome of judicial proceedings to which the company is, or may become a party; the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the proposed transactions or to satisfy the other conditions to the closing of the proposed transactions, including the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the combined company;

among other things, provide for the company to use the proceeds of the recently consummated debt financing to make a non-liquidating distribution to the holders of company membership units in an aggregate amount not to exceed the net proceeds of the debt financing received by the company (the “company distribution”). upon receipt of its portion of the company distribution, blocker intends to

agreement. in addition, the amendment amends the business combination agreement to, among other things, reduce the cash consideration payable by parentco under the business combination agreement at closing by an amount equal to the company distribution. the amendment does not modify or change the overall type of consideration or amounts to be received by the equity holders of open lending in connection with the business combination as compared to the type of consideration and amounts to be received by the equity holders of open lending in connection with the business combination if the

provisions under the united states private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, should, would, plan, predict, potential, seem, seek, future, outlook, and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, nebulas ability to consummate the potential business combination with the company. these statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of nebulas and the companys management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of nebula and the company. these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, political and business conditions, the continuing spread of covid-19 (also known as novel coronavirus or coronavirus disease 2019), applicable taxes, inflation, interest rates and 3 the regulatory environment, the outcome of judicial proceedings to which the company is, or may become a party, the inability of the parties to enter into definitive agreements or consummate the proposed business combination; the risk that the approval of the stockholders of nebula for the potential business combination is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the potential business combination, including as a result of a delay in consummating the potential business combination or difficulty in integrating the businesses of nebula and the company; the amount of redemption requests made by nebulas stockholders; those factors discussed in nebulas annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 under the heading risk factors, and other documents of nebula filed, or to be filed, with the sec. if the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither nebula nor the company presently do not know or that nebula and the company currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect nebulas and the companys expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this current report on form 8-k. nebula and the company anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause their assessments to change. however, while nebula and the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, nebula and the company specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing nebulas or the companys assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this current report on form 8-k. accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. item 9.01. financial

commercially reasonable efforts to have the resale registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof; provided, however, that parentco’s obligations to include

the securities of parentco held by such subscriber and the intended method of disposition of the shares, as shall be reasonably requested by parentco to effect the registration of such shares, and will execute such documents in connection with such registration, as parentco may reasonably request, which will be what is customary of a selling stockholder in similar situations. under certain circumstances, additional payments by parentco may be assessed with respect to the shares of common stock included in the registerable securities in the event that (1) a resale registration statement has not been declared effective by the sec by the earlier of (a) 90 days (or 120 days if the sec notifies parentco that it will “review” the resale registration statement) following the closing, or (b) 10 business days after the sec notifies parentco that it will not review the resale registration statement, subject to certain potential timing adjustments or (2) the resale registration statement is declared effective by the sec but thereafter ceases to be effective prior to the expiration of a designated effective period. the additional payments by parentco shall accrue on the applicable registrable securities at a rate of 0.5% of the aggregate purchase price paid for such registrable securities per month, subject to certain terms and limitations (including a cap of 5.0% of the aggregate purchase price). each subscription agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (w) such date and time as the agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) upon the

purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the united states private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “seem,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding 2020 ebitda and ebitda margin projections, estimates and forecasts of revenue and other financial and performance metrics and projections of market opportunity and expectations, nac’s ability to enter into definitive agreements or consummate a transaction with the company and nac’s ability to obtain the financing necessary consummate the potential transaction. these statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of nac’s and the company’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. these forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of nac and the company. these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including general economic, political and business conditions, applicable taxes, inflation, interest rates and the regulatory environment, the outcome of judicial proceedings to which the company is, or may become a party, the inability of the parties to enter into definitive agreements or consummate the proposed transaction; the risk that the approval of the stockholders of nac for the potential transaction is not obtained; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the potential transaction, including as a result of a delay in consummating the potential transaction or difficulty in integrating the businesses of nac and the company; the amount of redemption requests made by nac’s stockholders; those factors discussed in nac’s annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018 under the heading “risk factors,” and other documents of nac filed, or to be filed, with the sec. if the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. there may be additional risks that neither nac nor the company presently do not know or that nac and the company currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. in addition, forward-looking statements reflect nac’s and the company’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this current report on form 8-k. nac and the company anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause their assessments to change. however, while nac and the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, nac and the company specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. these forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing nac’s or the company’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this current report on form 8-k. accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. non-gaap financial measure and related information this current report on form 8-k references ebitda and ebitda margin, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (“gaap”). these non-gaap financial measures do not have a standardized meaning, and the definition of ebitda used by the company may be different from other, similarly named non-gaap measures used by others. in addition, such financial information is unaudited and does not conform to sec regulation s-x and as a result such information may be presented differently in future filings by the company with the sec. 13 item 9.01. financial

other events. nebula acquisition corporation, a delaware corporation (“nebula”), is in advanced discussions with a potential target company and expects to announce a deal shortly to acquire a high-growth, profitable financial technology business in the lending enablement and risk analytics space. the target company provides advanced analytics and risk-based pricing solutions to lenders through its technology platform; the platform leverages extensive proprietary data to help lenders better predict loan performance. the company is currently owned by the founders, management, and a number of other minority investors, including a prominent us-based growth equity firm. nebula believes that the company’s financial profile is compelling: consistent ebitda margins exceeding 50% and revenue growth above 30% for fiscal year 2018 and 2017. the total enterprise value of the proposed transaction is anticipated to be approximately $1.3 billion, representing a multiple of 2020 expected ebitda that is less than 13.0x. nebula believes the anticipated valuation at consummation of the transaction will represent a meaningful discount to relevant public comparable multiples in the financial technology and data analytics sectors. the seller and nebula are working toward entering into a definitive agreement for the transaction. nebula also has commitments for a significant amount of the financing necessary to effectuate the transaction. notably, true wind capital has committed meaningful equity from its private equity fund in support of the deal and management is expected to roll approximately 70% of their current ownership. completion of the transaction is subject to, among other things, the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement providing for the transaction, satisfaction of the closing conditions included therein and approval of the transaction by nebula’s stockholders. accordingly, there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be entered into or that the proposed transaction will be consummated. nebula has mailed to its stockholders of record as of december 3, 2019, a definitive proxy statement for a special meeting of stockholders to approve an extension of time for nebula to complete an initial business combination through june 12, 2020. currently, nebula anticipates publicly-announcing the deal before the extension vote on january 9, 2020. if nebula does not enter into a definitive agreement for an initial business combination by february 12, 2020 or if such agreement is subsequently terminated, nebula will promptly redeem all of the public shares for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account established in connection with nebula’s initial public offering. advisors deutsche bank securities, inc. ag and goldman sachs & co. llc are acting as capital markets advisors, financial advisors, and private placement agents, and greenberg traurig, llp is acting as legal counsel to nebula as part of the transaction. about nebula acquisition corporation nebula acquisition corporation, sponsored by true wind capital and led by adam h. clammer and james h. greene, jr., is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses in

forward-looking statements contained in this current report on form 8-k are subject to the following factors: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could delay the proposed transactions or give rise to the termination of the agreements related thereto; (ii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against spartan or the company following announcement of the proposed transactions; (iii) the inability to complete the proposed transactions due to the failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of spartan, or other conditions to closing in the agreements related to the proposed transactions; (iv) the risk that the proposed transactions disrupt spartan’s or the company’s current plans and operations as a result of the announcement of the proposed transactions; (v) the company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transactions, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of the company to grow and manage growth profitably following the proposed transactions; (vi) costs related to the proposed transactions; (vii) changes in applicable laws or regulations; and (viii) the possibility that the company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this current
